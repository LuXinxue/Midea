    Super Quiet
  
",4.0 ,Allen Risler,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 April 13, 2023","







  
  
    I found this unit in search of the quietest AC Unit.  This superior design is like a mini-split.  The window closes down to only open about 4"" which blocks the noisy part of the unit outside.  The first one arrived damaged but was quickly replaced.  Several reviews on YouTube show people using this 12,000 BTU cooling their entire first floor, around 1000 sq ft., even though it is rated for 550 sq ft, so I mounted this one in the living room.  This should significantly reduce the need to run the central AC and save a lot on the electric bill this summer.

    Manufacturing Issue
  
",1.0 ,MK53,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 April 12, 2023","







  
  
    After installing the mounting, we were ready to install the actual unit. We placed it on the mounting and then found that due to a manufacturing issue we couldn’t install a screw. The hole for the screw would not align due to a slight bowing issue. You can see in the second image how the seam/line is bigger near the bottom where it slightly bows out. That then doesn’t allow for an alignment of the hole in the third picture. Extremely frustrating to be moving something this big around just to find it doesn’t work and having to take the mounting down.

    EC 07 Fix! Had issues out of the box but got to work!
  
",3.0 ,Robert Lussier,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 April 12, 2023","







  
  
    Had issues directly out of the box, error code EC 07. Went through trouble shooting with the company and didn’t really help so decided to trouble shoot myself, noticed the condenser fan was kicking on and looked stuck and blocked. So i opened the back top side and found that the fan was getting stuck on some hard malleable black sticky stuff that was around hard pipes that lead to the condenser. I was able to form what i think is some type of insulation out of the way from the fan which allowed the fan to have enough room to spin. Put the AC back together and now works fine.This saved a trip to return to ups and the headache of getting a replacement.AC now blows cold and is super quiet, other than the above issues I’m satisfied with the product.

    Review update...I changed my review from a 1 star to a 4 star. After taking the ac apart I noticed some black gooey stuff that was causing the fan not to turn. I moved the goo over and now it works great.Looks nice and blows out really cold air for about 5 minutes then kicked off and showed EC 07 code. The fan isn't working.

    Easy to install. Would’ve been easier if I had a second person to help with it. The part that opens and closes the vent was broken. Had to use tape to keep the vent open. May try some superglue to try and fix the broken part. Could’ve used a bit more insulating foam. Had to order some more. Don’t like the remote control at all. Using the app or the smart speaker to control it works well.

    I got this to prevent my overzealous kitten from breaking out of the traditional accordion style window units. This thing is great and is very secure once everything is set up. The breeze it generates is amazing, and it cools my entire large apartment.I got the 12000 BTU and lifted it myself up 3 floors. So far I really like it and am happy I purchased this. I suggest watching install videos vs reading instructions only. It helped me.

    Quiet but there are too many air gaps
  
",2.0 ,Preferred Customer,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 April 11, 2023","







  
  
    Overall it's a good AC unit. It is quiet, so that's the best part. What I don't like is that there are too many gaps even after using all of the foam strips and panels that come with it. The bottom gaps are very obvious. I tried to seal them with duck tape, but apparently that's not enough because where I live, it's always windy, and the wind blows a great amount of dirt into the room from underneath the unit. Although I also used duck tape to seal the top and sides, in addition to the foam that came with it, dirt also comes in from the top and sides. That room, which is being used as a home office, is always so so dirty, as compared to the other bedrooms. I tried to see if I could buy new side panels to try to reinstall the unit in an effort to better seal the gaps, but the manufacturer only sells the thin black foam strips, which can be found anywhere (ex. Lowe's.) They DO NOT sell the side hard foam white panels that have the appearance of foam poster boards but thicker. I even chatted with one of their customer representatives, and they confirmed that they don't sell those. That's ridiculous!

    Pleasure to use, A demon to install, Warranty statement full of loop holes - Buyer Beware
  
",4.0 ,C4DB,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 April 9, 2023","







  
  
    Read the installation manual and decide if you can install it.  It took me half a day and I've installed a great many window AC's in the last 50 years.  (My Big Bend Texas ranch house has 5 right now.)  It's just a very complex installation that will vary greatly on your specific window and sill design and construction.  It's not the typical unbox, place in window, pull the sides in place and turn it on AC.  As to claims of quiet and energy efficiency:  All Claims are Absolutely True - nothing like it - get the specs from others - 15 on the Energy Star scale (max wattage is only 750) only 42 decibels loud (near silent), and very cold.  Mine arrived in an unblemished box, but upon opening showed signs of poor assembly and negligent packing.  Strongly suggest you buy a third party warranty since Midea's warranty statement has so many expensive loop holes that I believe it to be in violation of the Uniform Commercial Code.  In short - buy it from a company that will install it and service it if you can (not an option in the wilderness where I live).

    VERY quiet and I saved $$$ on my electric bill
  
",5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,James A. Jancik,评论于 2023年4月9日 在美国 🇺🇸 发布,"







  
  
    I bought my first via Media's GoFundMe page as I was attracted by the claimed very low noise and the use of DC and its lower electrical usage. They both turned out to be VERY true. I bought a second one and with the combined use, the electric bill dropped about 20% in the summer (over our other window units) and you virtually cannot hear it! I just bought my third to replace the unit in my sound studio because of the lack of noise and the Wi-Fi remote app so I can turn it on to cool off the studio before broadcasting/recording. The U-design was really irrelevant to me as I do not plan to open the windows while it is installed. But, it might significantly contribute to the now noise.The cost to buy the two is WAY lower than central air, and the cost to run them would be much lower than the projected electricity cost of the central AC as well.

    Great Feature Set and Very Quiet
  
",5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,JHH,评论于 2023年4月8日 在美国 🇺🇸 发布,"







  
  
    This is a very good window air conditioning unit, with a very well thought out installation process. It manages to look a bit less obtrusive than typical units of this type. It cools exceedingly well, and is very quiet in operation. The remote control is fully featured and works well. My only gripe is this (and I don't know if it's Midea's fault or Amazon's): the 360° view of the unit shows the exhaust fins as covered by a metal sheet and therefore not visible. In fact, the fins are just as visible on this product as they are on every other window air conditioner on the market. I am annoyed because this was a selling point for me, as it sits near the front of my home, and anything that can reduce ""that window air conditioner look"" would be a big plus. This unit performs so well, however, that I elected to keep it. I did paint the exterior housing and support bracket to match the house, so it blends in much better than out of the box, but I am nonetheless disappointed with the false representation of the product's appearance.

    This is the BEST window AC unit we’ve ever had. We like to keep our bedroom colder at night while turning off the heat/AC in the entire house. My problem has always been the noise of a window unit. I have sensitive hearing and the constant droning, on and off, of a standard window unit compressor keeps me up at night. We read the reviews about this brand and thought we’d give it a try. Amazingly quiet, efficient, easy to operate, and cools our 15x13 bedroom very well!!! Our only minor complaint was that the installation/instruction book was not written clearly.  Easy to remedy…we got online and watched several YouTube Midea installation videos. We would recommend this 1000%!

",5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,ruby,评论于 2023年4月7日 在美国 🇺🇸 发布,"







  
  
    I love the air conditioner, although I have a very wide window so I had to improvise to properly seal the unit as the support bracket does not stretch far enough to be screwed in to the side of window frame. The provided sealing blocks don’t compensate for wide windows. So what I did is cut the styrofoam packaging to the same dimensions as the foam blocks which worked perfectly, just make sure you make it a tight fit if you attempt this. I bought this because my central AC struggles in the summer so this will definitely help as well as it being quiet so it won’t disturb my baby as she sleeps.

    Do not buy this unit!  After only 1.5 years of operation the coils all along the bottom of the unit are corroded!!!  Most humans would never take them time to take it apart and clean it!  I felt compelled to do so because of a funky odor coming out of it.  After doing some research I decided to head to hardware store to purchase some coil cleaner and clean it myself as I am a professional handyman and felt i could take on the job. My recommendation to you is to stay away from this product as they refused to replace it do to the 1 year warranty policy!  This unit is defective and there is no way it should be on the market at all due to corrosion/materials issues!

    5 star unit but system for foam sealing is slightly awkward
  
",5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,BB,评论于 2023年4月2日 在美国 🇺🇸 发布,"







  
  
    I am truly awed by the design and function of this air conditioner, a machine that I've always taken for granted and largely ignored. As someone who has owned probably 10 window units in my life, this one's design is really a breath of fresh air (pun intended!). It's not just the fact that the window can go through the unit, which let's in a surprising amount of natural light that would otherwise be lost, it's also how well designed the safety precautions and unit-window fit are. The operation is quiet as heck, and the unit cools the place down fast. Moreover, in my opinion anyway, the price difference between this unit and a traditional one is really acceptable (~$150).Installation was easy, basically you just screw the support bracket into your window sill and let gravity do the rest. Where I would knock off .01 star—there are 4 different foam materials that come with the unit to fill in the negative space. In one case, you are surrounding a large foam block with foam ribbon. In another, you are taping adhesive foam to cover holes in the bracket. In both cases, there is not enough foam ribbon or adhesive foam, and my window is only 32"" wide. Easy enough, just bought more at hardware store, but I was surprised that even after applying the four different foam materials as instructed, there was still a lot of space left to fill, especially considering how well everything else was designed (including the app). Def an amazing purchase.

    The product kept tripping my circuit breaker after about 5 to 10 seconds of plugging it in. I have another portable unit that I use on the same outlet that uses considerably more power and has no issue. I called support to try to figure out if I should order a new one, and when I was asking about the product, they refused to help me and acted stupid until I gave them a model number.  I told them him it was the 8000 BTU window slotted unit that you could open and close your window with.  I told him I didn’t care about the unit I had because I’m sending it back and I’m going to order another one. I want to make sure I won’t have the same issue, but they kept concentrating on the unit that I had packed up in my garage and wanted me to go out there to get the actual model off the box. I have done support before and I knew my products well enough to provide support based on basic product information.  It is literally the first product that comes up. When you look at the window air conditioners.  They paid Slater from saved by the bell to do an advertisement for them for this air conditioner, and they acted like they had no idea what air conditioner I was talking about.  I actually asked for a supervisor and she got all pompous and said, why did you need a supervisor?!?!Also, the installation was awful. The foam pieces didn’t fit very well and weren’t very flexible, if that is the right word.  I had to cut slots into the foam to get it to go into the grooves of where the window slides.  There were still gaps, also gaps under the air conditioner where bugs can get in.All this effort installing it is, it didn’t even work. Do yourself a favor and plug it in first to see if trips your circuitry.  first picture is their unit power usage, and the second picture is the portable one I use with no issue in the same exact outlet.  The portable one uses far more power without any issues. I plugged into a UPS and left the UPS plugged in and same issue.  No erratic power I will spikes when the unit tripped the circuit though  Nothing for several minutes of letting it run on the ups to show any irregularities to cause it to keep tripping the circuit.  This is also with turning everything else in the room off.  The higher power portable air conditioner runs fine with everything else on in the room. The portable air conditioner is a 6.6 seer rating and the window unit is a 15 seer rating.  It makes no logical sense why this much of lower wattage unit is causing such an issue.  I guess I will never know because their support refused to help me because I wouldn’t go out to my garage to get the model number. All I wanted was confirmation that the unit was defective and this wasn’t normal.

    My partner and I purchased this AC because the one we had was so loud we couldn’t be in the room with it on. This new AC is very beautiful, high tech, and SUPER quiet. My only complaint with it is that it’s not super powerful. We got 800 BTU for a bedroom which is reasonable and it took a few hours to cool off. Since it’s energy efficient and so quiet, we just leave it on all the time so we don’t have to worry about how long it takes to cool off. Also using the app on your phone is pretty easy to control the AC from anywhere. It even tells you current temp inside and outside. I can’t speak for install because someone did that for me.

    I love this AC unit. A bit of a fiddle to install, but once installed it's perfect. Doesn't block the view out of the window, the window can be raised on those days when ac isn't needed, it's so quiet -quieter than my fridge! It's very efficient. I used one in my downstairs, which is roughly 1000 sq ft, and it did a great job of keeping it cool. I'll be getting a couple more!

    Not recommended for humid climate - lack of drainage hole causes stagnant and odorous water buildup
  
",2.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,Amazon Customer,评论于 2023年3月27日 在美国 🇺🇸 发布,"







  
  
    Bought this unit 3 months ago based on good general reviews and innovative designs. Installation was pretty easy and I followed directions to make sure it slanted backwards. Unit ran well and was good at meeting my cooling needs; everything seemed great at first.About 2 months in, started noticing a foul smell whenever the fans first start running from idle. Cleaned out the filter but the issue persisted. Started googling about this and discovered that many people had complaints with mold growth in this unit due to difficulty in taking the unit apart for cleaning, and also lack of drainage hole in the outside portion.I finally took the unit down and opened it up outside after the smell became unbearable and started to negatively affect my health. I discovered that about a third of the bottom of the outside unit is constantly submerged in about an inch and half of gross brownish gunky water filled dead bugs and god knows what. This water just sits there stagnant in the back of the ac, not high enough to spill out of the overflow, and a sniff confirmed that this was indeed the source of the same smell that I was getting indoors.After researching extensively into this topic, I found that Midea purposely doesn't have drainage holes in this unit so the fan can scope up the residual water buildup and splash it around as a cooling mechanism to save energy. There are however problems I found with this explanation; First of all, the circular scoop that the fan uses to pick up the water doesn't sit flush against the bottom of the case; Its actually about an inch up. This means that there needs to be at least an inch of water inside the case for it to even start using this feature. Unless this water is freshly condensed and then evaporates out routinely, you are going to have a stagnant water buildup inside this case, especially if you live anywhere humid like I do. What ends up happening is that you get a pool of gunky water filled with gross mold and whatnots, that the fan then picks up and proceeds to splash on all the fins in the machine, which eventually translates to unpleasant odor being blown into your room whenever it starts up.I rather not be breathing nasty, disease causing air compared to Midea hitting an energy saver milestone. At least give us the option of drain holes with plugs or something so we can choose between efficiency vs cleanliness . Unless you live somewhere really dry, or doesn't need to use this thing often, I cannot recommend a purchase of this unit. Giving it two stars because it actually works well with cooling (so far), but this is a major issue.Also. the fans on the indoor portion of the ac cannot be reached to be cleaned unless you take the entire front portion apart, unhooking wires, cables and all. Very unfriendly design for sustainable general maintenance.

    This product didn’t last a year. It stopped working after a possible “power surge”; however, none of mine appliances were affected. I don’t know if that was the root cause. I followed the manual and I tried to reset it, but it displays 06 EH. I called Midea and requested a technician. “Anthony”, customer service rep, was rude and brash. He kept cutting me off and said he needed a “yes” or “no” answer. He kept putting me on hold to speak with his supervisor. At the end, he said because I said after a “power surge”, it’s not covered by the warranty. How can you make an assessment and assumption without looking at the unit?? Midea…POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE!!

    This product was interesting for the energy savings and reducing noise levels which are a massive annoyance for me. Started out spectacular and still cools well. The problem is 1 year into owning it the unit has devolved a droning electrical buzz that refuses to go away. It is louder when the unit fan speed is on high but still very much loud and present even on the low fan speed. I would much rather get a traditional ac unit going forward and never intend on dealing with this much more frustrating electrical buzz ever again.

    So far I’m impressed by the level of noise this unit generates. I don’t have a decibel meter to tell exactly, but there is a lot less noise coming in to the room from the street or the unit itself. How much more energy efficient it is, I can’t tell yet. The installation is not difficult at all, just a few extra steps than a conventional window unit. So far I’m happy.

    I bought the 8,000 BTU Midea window unit for our master bedroom and now I can set the thermostats for both floors up to about 80° during the night and my master bedroom can be set on 67° for the night. We are empty nesters so this works for us. If your other bedrooms are occupied you probably have to run your central unit or put one of these small units in each bedroom. I don't see the reason to cool my entire 3100 sq ft two story home during the night just to make it comfortabel in the 200 sq ft master bedroom. My electric bill dropped to about 1/3 of what it was and we sleep at a much cooler temperature. The unit is also very quiet on lower speeds. It has a variable speed motor so after the room cools down the unit will run at such a low speed you cannot even hear it. The vent only stays open when the AC is running and sometimes I'll walk by and the vent is open and I'm thinking ""is that thing running"". And I'll put my hand in front of it and I can feel cold air coming out. Although when  you first turn it on and it's running on high speed you can hear it but its more of a louder humm.The only Con is that about once a year you have to vacuum the blades of the squirrel cage fan that blows the cold air or air flow slow down to about nothing. And Midea put some sort of wire quard in front of the squirrel cage fan blade that prevents easy cleaning. Here's what I did; take a pair of pliers and just pull the wire quard out of the unit. To do this you have to bend the air flow cover up in the center and pop it off the two pegs that hold it in to be able to get at the fan. Then pull the grey plastic air diverter blades up out of the holes and set them aside. Then with a pair of pliers or wire cutters pull that damn wire guard out so you get a vacuum in there and vacuum the fan blades. You can probably expect to do this once a year. Once you get the guard out of the way and toss it in the trash the rest of the job is really easy to do once or twice a year.I like the wi-fi app making it easy to set the temp way down. We can be across town and before we are heading home for the evening I'll open my app and turn the unit on. By the time we get up to the bedroom it's 67° while the outside temp is a blazing 100° and the rest of the house is set to 80°. This little unit has paid for itself in the first few months.

    One Week Review:This thing has been great. It was easy to install (I did it myself, though having an extra pair of hands is recommended) , it is very very quiet, and it is keeping my room nice and cool. It does this relatively quickly too. Being able to lower my curtain in between the window and the unit is great as well at keeping the light down. The swing option is amaaaazing. The instructional video they provide is also excellent and easy to follow for the most part.I only have 2 minor complaints. The vented cover on the front doesn't really like to stay in place. It always sticks out on one side. I just taped both sides and it stays. I also don't love how if you power the AC off, it doesn't remember your setting when you turn it back on.5 Stars!

    I think I'm regretting not winter proofing it. I think the snow and rain did a number on my favorite AC. It seems so much louder then when we first Brough it. I'd still but it again, in fact we're getting one for the livingrm this spring. We never used the remote, just the app on our phones. Love the app! It cools down 2+ rooms if we keep the door open, and doesn't wake a Infant. Lets see how it is with a toddler this summer.

    This is The Most quietest window AC unit we have ever owned...period!  We set the temperature the day that we installed it and haven't touched it since. We keep it on auto fan and eco cool and the little unit comes on and adjust things on it's own as needed to keep our desired temperature. We've never even put batteries into the remote as we really don't need it. The first unit arrived damaged and Amazon had it picked up and a new one delivered within the week.As a matter of fact, we liked this unit so much that we ordered two more of different BTU sizes to fit our needs....Why?...Because our central air needs to be completely replaced after 20 years and they want almost $9,000 to put in the new outside compressor and the inside blower unit. So these 3 window units are keeping our home just as cool and we saved $7,500 by Not replacing the central air.  Plus, if one goes bad one day, we can just slide it out ourselves and slide a new one in. (Will NEVER have to call some AC company to come out and charge us a fortune ever again)!And financially speaking, with the $7,500 that we saved, we could buy another 15 window units!!! That's right, another 15 window AC units.!!! So as long as our Midea units keep working like they should, we are making out like bandits.

    Installing

    I’m a contractor and I build and install things all week long every week, year round. I installed this unit for a client today in a attic of a log cabin. Took me about 2.5 hrs to install it. First time I installed this model. I took my time and watched a YouTube video on how to do the installation. The YouTube video was excellent.  All the parts were in the box.  I did have to add cedar shims on the outside of the house for the angle brackets.  I also added some larger deck screws into the window bracket into the window frame. Just to be safe.  The tools I used were impact driver, drill bit to pre drill, a small screw driver, a large screw driver, tape measure, extra deck screws, pencil, a knife to cut the insulation foam.  You would not have to have a impact driver to do this project. I did have a hard time getting the anti tip brackets out after I installed the unit. My suggestion is to take the clear tape off and make sure the anti tip brackets go in and out before you install the unit. The anti tip brackets were kind of hidden. Otherwise it wasn’t that bad to install.  Hope this helps.It’s a neat and well thought out design.

    I love the physical air conditioner itself, it’s quiet and efficient and cools very well and it installs easily.  The phone app for controlling the AC used to work great, but Midea is trying to force everyone onto a new app that fails to connect to the AC the majority of the time which makes this formerly great AC very frustrating to use. I have an iPhone and the App Store also shows that the new app will access my photos and videos and audio recordings— that seems entirely unnecessary for an app that is just supposed to turn on/off an air conditioner and set the temperature.  In conclusion, if you are satisfied using the buttons on the unit, or the included remote control, then this is a great air conditioner, but if you’d like to control the AC remotely or from a smart device then be prepared for frustration and failure.

    Third one now.  They are like having a mini-split system without having to mess with charging gas lines and running tubes.  Very quiet compared to the old fashioned AC boxes.  The variable speed compressor motor being able to run at only the speed needed is such a great improvement over the old style.  We ran 3 of these all summer and our electric bill did go up but not nearly what it used to with the central air system.  At least $100 a month lower.  I'm going to get a 4th one for next Summer to complete my whole house cooling system.  It's definitely worth paying a bit more for this than for a regular box AC.  The lower noise level is worth it for just that alone.

    My wife hates noise in the bedroom at night, but she also hates being too warm in bed, so an air conditioner, for the bedroom is always been a compromise for us.Until we found this one. This machine has a revolutionary design that keeps the “noisy parts” outside the window, where it keeps squirrels awake. On the inside of the window is only a vent and some controls, making for a significantly quieter experience than any air conditioner we’ve ever tried, including a couple that are supposed to be “the worlds quietest”.We used it all summer in ‘22, so only one year of use on this so far, but it worked without a hiccup, and the noise level seemed like less than half of anything we had previously.If I had four thumbs, they would all be pointed up for this product! :-)

It’s nice and quiet and works very well. It ran nearly full time 10 or 11 months of that timeframe.

During the rest of the year I run it an hour or half hour just to cool the room down at night and it stays comfortable.  There is a timer on it for that so it's set it and forget it.  It does make strange noises at times and it's shut off on me before without a timer on.  I wake up several times at night so if it's off, I just turn it back on.

I only use low as it'll freeze me out even come Summer time!Only ""con"" is that you'll have to get creative with covering as blinds/curtains will stop at the top of the unit and as this doesn't use the ""accordion style"" covering of other models, the window is see through on the sides of the AC.

    We have bought 2 of these and we are 100% satisfied, beyond quiet, you do have to set up this thing that holds it up, but it's pretty easy and they send you all of that, you can control it from their app so if you're gone you don't have to run it and you can turn it on remotely before you get home so you're cool, nothing like the old style window units, very efficient on power last bill for the summer (S.C) was 68 dollars and that was from running 2 the entire time, the living room one at 78 and the bedroom at 65, it will come on and go off if set high like 78 or keep running if set low like 65, the remote is solid, not rinky dink, can't recommend this product enough.

    I purchased this unit for a bonus room above my garage a little over a year ago, and it plain and simple, and doesn't cool as expected.  The room size is within the 12,000 BTU range, but the unit simply isn't cooling as it should.  This includes turning off ECO mode, setting the temperature to the lowest (66 degrees), and the fan speed on high.  The warranty just went out at the end of October so I am stuck with a $500 u-shaped paperweight.  I definitely cannot recommend this brand to anyone, and if you see the name brand ""Midea,"" run in the other direction.  For reference, I had a GE unit (same 12,000 BTU) that lasted 6 years in the same room. Very disappointed...

    My girlfriend complained of an odor and upon inspection I found the AC was riddled with mold. We have a pretty dry climate in our house, so I looked it up. Apparently this is a known and frequent issue. There are forums on creating a hydrogen peroxide spray and drilling proper drainage holes. I like the design of the AC, and it did an ok job at cooling two rooms (1000BTU would expect more) but this is my first time dealing with mold in an AC unit.

Sadly Midea just told me I was out of warranty and to contact a technician to repair it. No compensation for a defective product or anything. Horrible product. Waste of $400 dollars. The worst product I’ve bought on Amazon and I’ve spent a lot and try to support small companies. Most of them are great but Midea the worst. I have a 7 year old A/C from GE and it works smooth.

    UPDATE!! THE COMPRESSOR CAME BACK TO WORK BY ITSELF AGAIN!I just disconnected the AC, took it  to another room, mounted it in the window, away from the heater, plugged it into  the wall outlet and the compressor started to work again. It doesn't give me the ""EC07"" compressor defective message anymore.  I have been testing it for 3 weeks now, and it is working fine.!  I think that the problem was that in my bedroom where the AC was before, it was receiving too much heat from the heater that was underneath, and that might have affected the electronic part  of the AC.(December 26, 2022)This MIDEA unit broke down after a year and 5 months.It started giving the ""EC07"" DEFECTIVE MESSAGE., This means the ""COMPRESSOR FAILED, IT BROKE DOWN"".I called customer service, they advise to call the repair company.They said they won't repair it because their warranty only lasts one year.This unit also has problem common with other AC unit: the fan collects mold and heavy dust inside the fan.I called the company and they don't offer any advise on how to clean it; they said you should call a repair service to clean it and you have to pay for it.The company also doesn't recommend to spray water to clean the dust and mold.  And also they don't recommend you to do it yourself.This is how other people clean the other brand of AC that they have.Other people had the same problem, according with the reviews I checked.I am searching for a new AC unit from another brand.

    I bought my Midea 8000BTU AC in October 2020 and loved it for 1.5 years. Due to allergies and asthma, I run my AC and air purifier in the bedroom nightly. In the last year, my allergy symptoms in the mornings have worsened. I’ve had to clean mold off the swing arm a couple times (see pic). Last week, I shined a flashlight into the unit and saw rust buildup on the metal bars and mold inside the unit. I can’t dismantle the unit to clean inside and Midea doesn’t include a planned maintenance schedule or authorized service places, so I guess Midea doesn’t plan on customers using their AC units long term.  In order to avoid health problems, I’ll  be throwing this Midea AC out and purchasing a unit that’s made to use long-term and designed to be serviced every year.

However, when purchasing the second one for the spare bedroom there was a hissing noise that developed even when the unit was off.

    This thing is quiet... almost TOO quiet!
  
",4.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,Raymond Gorman,评论于 2022年11月23日 在美国 🇺🇸 发布,"







  
  
    Came across this model before the summer really kicked in after shopping around for a replacement for our old AC unit that started to sound like a popcorn machine. Claims of energy efficiency crossed with a nearly silent operation sounded pretty good. Checked reviews (not just Amazon ones, either) and decided to try it out. In my case, installation was *bit* tricky being on the 4th floor with no outside access, and a bit of an oddball window setup. But I was able to, by trial and error, get it setup and level. I turned it on and... I thought it was broken it was so quiet compared to the previous unit (before the popcorn thing). Because of the reported efficiency, I was able to go from a 10,000 to this 8,000 BTU size. And it was perfect- just as cool as the previous larger noisier unit. Installing the App and setting up a schedule was, after some fiddling, no real trouble and did work fine. One caveat I did find, is when you remotely turn it on (if I was not using the scheduler) to have it cool off the room while on my way home, once I DID get home the remote would not change the temperature, fan speed, etc... Seems the App would override the remote or something. I finally figured out that you need to press the Power Button, which 'wakes up' the Unit and releases control to the remote. A bit odd, but livable, all things considered. The other issue is, living in an urban environment, that this unit might be TOO quiet. Previous unit was a ""white noise"" generator, covering the sounds of traffic, ambulances, loud exhaust noise, etc... Almost comforting. this unit has the compressor located outside the window and being so quiet, then let in all that outside noise! So I had to get used to that ""Urban Soundscape"" again and learn to block it out like all urbanites tend to do. Definitely would recommend and buy again if needed!

    The remote control is useless. Simply does not work and doesn't even look like it's for this model. The AC cools quickly and more quietly than any window unit I've seen. The phone app has worked great, so lack of remote not so much an issue.

    The first house i ever bought in south MS 30 years ago had a monster of a window unit, the only good thing about it was it could drown out the sound of trains going through my back yard, in hot summers it could cost more to run than the actual house payment. i never thought i would want another window unit in my lifetime but lately i have used a couple of roll around units in the 10-12000 btu range and they sucked. So i broke down and  found this Midea that came highly recommended by Reggie, yeah, that Reggie. I goth the 10K unit, installed it myself, even though it says not to, and had it going in less than an hour. If you get this unit, please get someone to help with the install, you aren't me after all.  I have it installed in my bedroom window and i can watch tv at night with this unit on full blast, although i never keep it on full blast, it would be an icebox if i did. Keeps roughly 300 sq ft cool on lowest setting. If you actually read these long pointless reviews just to try and figure out if  you  should buy this unit, quit wasting your time reading the ramblings of amateurs (at best) and just get it, you will not regret it, its a great, efficient, quiet, and easy to install unit.

    I've had many window units and this is by far the nicest and quietest. It does make noise but nothing like the ones I've had in the past. I have it installed in my bedroom that was a garage converted into a room ... it only has one small vent from the main house A/C unit, so it does a poor job of cooling in the summer. This window unit was perfect for my room.The install was a little more of a pain that I would have wanted -- I put it in a small window that was barely big enough but I got it done and it looks great.I LOVE that the lights can be turned off at night. Can't stand all the glowing lights of all the different appliances while I'm trying to sleep, so I really appreciate that the A/C isn't adding to that.My biggest complaint really is the remote. It is a pain. You have to point it at just the right spot or it does not work. Kinda dumb to have such a nice unit with such a faulty remote.

    I do recommend this AC, but be prepared to buy your own weatherstripping. The seals included in the box are crap. One semi-major design flaw. The bottom of the mounting bracket is not flat, leaving a gap under the bracket/on top of the window sill. You'll need to fill it with pieces of foam. Other than that it is a good product and I have already bought a second one.

The stand  was not as easy to installed but I lived in a very old building with odd windows. The foam to cover the corners also was not easy to fit or used but once installed, they worked great.  The design is fantastic for a high rise building like mine since the window secures the unit. Highly recommend the product.

     I bought this unit end of 2021 summer, used it for 2 months, and then it sat until 2022. Used it all summer into fall when it started developing issues.So they offer a 15 month warranty, and the unit literally starts developing issues at SIXTEEN months so they won't honor the warranty.Which makes this basically a scam. You're spending 2x the amount of money for an extra quiet unit that's supposed to be state of the art design but it can't handle more than 6 months operating time before it starts to break down.I've attached a video of the ""super quiet unit"" and the noise it starts making after 16 months.Buyer beware.

    Best window AC I've ever had. Perfect.
  
",5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,AN,评论于 2022年11月8日 在美国 🇺🇸 发布,"







  
  
    I have the 8,000 BTU model.1) Noise:  This is by far the most quiet AC I’ve ever had.  No loud thunk when the compressor kicks on.  It’s just a soft, low hum.  The fan alone is extremely quiet.  I actually prefer a little more noise because I live in NYC, but I just use my white noise machine.2) Buttons/Operation:  Buttons are super clear, have a nice tactile response, and cover almost every function.  The only thing you cannot do with a button is turn off the *beep* noise (which happens every time you press a button or change a setting either on the ac itself or using the remote), or turn off the LED lights.3) Remote:  Remote is great although I really never use it.  I just use the app.  The best thing about the remote is the ability to turn off the LED lights.  The unit emits zero light with this turned off.  It’s such a great function!  No bright lights bothering me while I sleep!4) App:  The app seems janky at first, but it’s actually amazing.  It works perfectly — it even allows you to control the ac from OUTSIDE your home!  You can turn it on an hour before you get home to make sure it’s nice and cool, or turn it off if you forgot to before you left.  I LOVE the ability to pre-cool my apartment.You can also create schedules, favorite settings, see outdoor vs indoor temperature, change temperature units, and lots of other things.  It’s a fantastic add-on that adds to the value immensely.5) Cooling ability:  the unit works pretty fast, but not crazy fast.  You can change the direction of the air flow manually by swiveling the airflow gates, which makes a difference.  It cools a room off I’d say within 20 minutes, depending on how hot it is.6) Other:  it has these really robust plastic pull tabs in the back that prevent the window from being pulled up.  This is a great safety precaution for intruders, but also for kids playing around with the window.  And you cannot push this thing in or out; it ain’t goin no where.Single Downside:  I have blackout blinds in my bedroom that are 2” wide and the unit blocks them from going all the way to the sill.  I have been using a piece of cardboard behind the unit against the glass to keep sunlight/morning light from getting in and waking me up.  I wish my blind wasn’t so wide.You have about 1.5” maximum of clearance between the unit and the inside of the window against the glass, so any blind with a width less than that would still work.That’s it!  It’s freaking awesome. If you have been wavering on buying it, pull the trigger.  It’s and incredible, innovative, quiet and safe alternative to the traditional window unit.

    Yes, this AC is as advertised: it's quiet, it's efficient, and it's difficult to install.However, be warned: due to this unit's surge in popularity, Midea DOES NOT HAVE ANY SPARE PARTS. This means that if any part is damaged or broken upon arrival (not unlikely, since most of these units are being shipped thousands of miles), OR just from the basic day-to-day wear-and-tear that any room unit goes through, Midea will NOT be able to REPLACE the part for you, even if they acknowledge you're entitled to a replacement.I received my AC at the end of August -- a part arrived broken. I nonetheless decided to install the AC, trusting that Midea's warranty would cover their faulty manufacturing. When I emailed them about the problem, it took days for them to respond, and I had to jump through various hoops, sending photos, copies of my receipt, and a statement that ""I did not break the piece myself."" Once they confirmed that I was entitled to a refund, they informed me that the piece (the Front Grille, essential for the maintenance of any window unit) would be sent as soon as the unit was once again available, in ONE MONTH!Since then, two months have passed, and I still do not have the part -- they delayed sending the part twice after I courteously asked when I could expect to receive it, and they are now refusing to answer any of my emails.If you want to take a gamble, I recommend you get this unit. Otherwise, I'd recommend getting a Danby --  they have highly personalized customer service, great products, and are North American-made (Midea is a Chinese corporation).

    Quiet, beautifully designed, good quality materials. I wasn’t sure if this was just another cheap overseas product. I was wrong. This Midea air conditioner is Amazing. Our old noisy window a/c was making me crazy. This solved the problem. Quiet and Ice Cold. Looks good too😊

    After 2 summers, 2 installs, and 2 removals, this AC cools very well and is quiet and efficient.My only problem is the lower right part of the inside case which has now had a 1"" chip of plastic break off.Was it cracked when I got it or was it damaged from the strain put on by the very heavy power cord which comes out of this corner.  As a result, the inside grill sags a bit and may need to be taped on next summer if I can't glue the piece back on.  Taping will complicate cleaning the air filter, etc.Looking at this, the plastic design of the inside case in this area is not strong enough for the strain and interaction between the power cord and the grill support which goes through the hole.Over time this chip could crack further and compromise the inside case.  I guess I'll try to see if reasonably priced replacement parts are available?

    i tried to use this AC-unit on window a bit larger than its max-range and the install still worked and it feels secure and all the gaps are filled. the intricacies/oddities of my apartment building meant the under-carriage supports didn't work, so maybe be extra certain of the depth of your exterior wall/sill.but, otherwise, it cools the whole apartment (~750sqf) quite well, the app is very easy to use, i like the different modes and vent swing, etc.now that the summer is over i will probably confirm this in my energy-providers records, but i do feel like it wasn't as energy efficient as i expected; that is to say, i previously had *two* a bit less powerful units in the same apartment but with similar use-levels, and i feel like my energy bill was a fair bit less than it was this summer. again, not totally confirmed and this is a much more powerful unit than i had previously, so that could just be too much difference to compare properly.

    We bought several of the 12,000 BTU units for our house that had no A/C Units. Positives - fairly easy to install, super quiet operation, and did a great job keeping things cool.That is, until we started having issues. The first thing we ran into was one of the units - thankfully while I was in the room - made a sudden whining noise and smoke started coming from it. Turned out the internal fan had seized and it was attempting to keep turning it. It would definitely have caught fire had I not been in the room and immediately shut it off.We then started looking at the other two we had, and I discovered something nearly as bad - all of them had mold/mildew problem inside the units. I'm not the only one seeing this, and it turns out there's no way to open the unit to clean the inside of it. We had to pull all of the units. So while we loved them while they worked, I wouldn't recommend purchasing Midea U units with those two major flaws.

    worked great all summer long. Last year I used an inferior product. It still cooled the room just fine but it was loud loud loud and my energy bill went through the roof. With this unit here I hardly noticed an uptick in the electric bill at all, is reasonably quiet, and the remote is really nice too.

    This was a great addition to an upstairs room that is primarily used by a teenager. Set to 78° when off for the summer, they're comfortable and you're not paying to cool the whole house.

    Operating it at economy setting the Electric bill did not go up much. The High setting does make light go down, so that probably pullls quite some electricity. It is quiet (my #1 requirement) and it cools quite well for 1 room, but not an entire floor. Installing is not a problem, count on 1-1.5 hour.  Recommended.

    Pros. Unit cools well and is quiet. The u shape makes for a much better installation. It's nice that the display can be turned off as it is being used in a bedroom.Cons. Will not keep a constant temperature. Temperature will alternate between two degrees higher and three to four degrees lower than set temperature. Unit will enter eco mode or change from auto to cool and fan setting then changes to constantly on from auto when temperature is adjusted by using the remote.

    Best Window A/C Unit I have ever had
  
",5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,Sarah Snyder,评论于 2022年10月16日 在美国 🇺🇸 发布,"







  
  
    First of all, we bought this for the fact that it is supposed to be quiet.  My wife is a light sleeper and the cycling on and off of our old unit would always wake her up, and it had the loudest beep when you turned it on, off, or changed the temps.  So I spent many summer nights way too warm to sleep.  No more! This thing is QUIET! You can turn the beeps off so that's a huge plus in my life.  I can set this, and go to sleep and you can not ever hear it turn on older than a faint and quiet little high pitch whistle.  I didn't think about it until we had it but you can use the app to turn it on from anywhere. SO when those hot days creep in and all the humans are at work, I can open the app, see the current temp inside the bedroom and turn it on to cool the room down for all the fur babies. Less than a sec long and barely noticeable. It works great, cools the room fast, gets really cold if you want it to, it's quiet, no annoying beeps, has a remote, easy to use app with favorite settings...seriously, buy it.  This thing made summer less of a pain and everyone was happy with the purchase.  The only cons and they are so minor.... is the foam stuff they give you isn't super great, and if you have blinds then you will need to black out the window on the sides of the unit if you don't want sun coming in, but I can find or purchase stuff cheap to fix such things. Very happy with this purchase!

    Worse experience ever with this AC. It only worked for a month then started making a loud noise and it would not cool the room as much. I got in contact with Amazon and try to return it. I finally returned it and they told me it takes about 30 days to get my money back because the purchase was more than $300.00 now I’m contacting customer service and they are telling me I need to fill out this form to get my money back.. but they already have the AC with them for over a month! What is taking so long. I will never buy an AC from Amazon again. This brand is not good. And I would like my money back please. I don’t know what else I need to do. It’s not like I have the AC with me… I’m very dissatisfied with this purchase

    I have 3 of these units, 2 8k btu and 1 12k btu. There are many things to like, energy efficient, quiet, nice looking. But there are some deficiencies in the design. The interior air fan, which is a squirrel cage blower, is prone to collect dirt and develop mold, and is not dedigned to be easily cleaned by the user. And on the 12k btu unit, there seems to be something in the software logic that prevents the unit ftom running at full capacity sometimes. It doesn't seem to have the cooling capacity of a traditional 12 k btu unit. I suggest a look at the Midea U Shaped Facebook users' group for info.

Sound quality perfect. I loved that it did not block the light and, very important, provided security: it would be very difficult for someone to pull it out in order to gain access through the window.I am planning to buy a second one for a different space.

    A bit complicated at first to put in the window but it’s  beautiful in operation and cools nicely. Planning on purchasing more for the bedrooms. The best part is the quiet operation as it subtly fills the room with the pleasant coolness desired. The 24,000 BTU unit comes with the pedestal so no need to purchase that as an extra. Enjoy your U-shaped window AC!

    I bought this unit June 28, 2020. Installation was easy, it was quiet and super powerful. The app was fantastic, and interfaced with Alexa and Google Home seamlessly. It worked without flaw until May 2022. This is when I contacted Midea for support.An error code appeared on the front panel would display the error code PC-00, and the compressor would no longer run. I contacted Midea, and they had no clue what the error was, but took my information and told me that the warranty had expired. Over the next 4-months, Midea would call me back periodically and say that it may be an issue with the compressor, and that was still under warranty and they would check to see what they could do. August rolled around and I just got sick of waiting to hear back, so I uninstalled the unit and threw it away. Several weeks later near September Midea called back and I told them that I just thew the unit away as it had been months since I initially contacted them.I loved the unit, I loved how quite it was. I recommended it to everyone I knew. Had I known that the company would refuse to stand behind their product and that I would have wasted $500 on it, I would never have purchased. I cannot in good faith recommend anyone to buy this as if it breaks, the company will not support their product at all.

    This is one of the best window shakers on the market. Very easy to install! We have awkward sized windows and were able to secure it just fine. It's quiet and cools very fast and efficiently. The compressor being on the other side of the window really makes a difference in noise level. JUST MAKE SURE YOU MEASURE YOUR WINDOW BEFORE YOU BUY. It will not secure correctly if your window is too small. Definitely worth the money! Remote can act as a Thermostat and it cycles and maintains the set temperature just perfectly.

    We gave this as a baby shower gift and it was the hit of the party.For someone who doesn't have whole house air-conditioning, and still wants to be able to open the window without removing the unit, this is a great choice. It's quiet (perfect for a bedroom) and takes up less space than traditional window units.

    Slick design, good cooling, major issues with fan motor
  
",3.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,ThatGuy,评论于 2022年9月27日 在美国 🇺🇸 发布,"







  
  
    Start with the good. I bought 4 of these for my home, and they install pretty easily. The design is good, I had hoped it wpuld reduce noise from the busy road near my house. Eh. But they themselves are very quiet! That is, until the fan motors fail. 2 of these units started emitting a high pitched wine anytime the fan is running. And of course it happened right after warranty period of one year. I am pretty mechanically skilled so changing out a motor is nbd to me, however this is where I have a bone to pick with Midea. They do not have a part number or sell this part that clearly fails and is an issue. Their support was very unhelpful, and the only way I replaced the motor was to open it up, get the part number, and order one from China on ebay. 70 bucks and an hour or so of repair time and it is quiet again, for how long? Who knows.  They should step up QC or extend warranty, and please ffs stock common parts that break. Maybe consider putting higher quality motors in a unit this pricey.

    Was really excited to get this ac unit going in my new apartment, as I moved somewhere that geographically didn't previously need built-in ac units (thanks climate change). Got everything set up, plugged in, and on, and it was very quiet, which I was impressed with, for about 30 seconds until it turned off! Turned out, there was an error code that ended up being a broken temperature sensor. After speaking with customer service, had to pack it all up and send it back. So I would recommend that anyone who does take a chance on this unit, please plug it in and test it before you get it set up in your window. It did blow cold and it was decently quiet, but I can't rate higher than three stars because it was a lot of trouble to go through for something that I just had to turn around and send right back. Disappointed, but maybe others will have better luck.

    this AC looks nicer & sleeker than others I’ve had, cools well, and the fan is much quieter than the one I replaced (no more turning cup tje tv so we can hearing it over the AC).it would be a five star review if not for the annoying high pitched noise it makes when cooling!if you’re not sensitive to electronic noises or don’t have sensitive hearing it might not be a issue (it’s not a loud sound & some of my friends don’t notice it), but it’s extremely irritating if you do. I actually prefer the loud fan noise of my old AC over this. I searched online & saw that a bunch of other people have had the same issue with multiple units so it’s not worth the hassle for me to try and return, but I’m really disappointed my “quiet” AC is making this terrible sound. it happens during cooling only, not when just the fan is on

I will let it sit in its upright position for 24 hrs. before plugging it in and turning it on. Not doing so risks premature wear and damage to the compressor since the internal lubricant migrated from where it is supposed to be.

    Good little a/c unit for the garage
  
",5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,jettatrekgirl,评论于 2023年3月8日 在美国 🇺🇸 发布,"







  
  
    I bought this for my garage. I live in Alabama. It is March 7, 2023 and was 86 degrees today. This air conditioner was delivered today, so you know I had to install it! Packaging was easy to remove. Now, I must have the world's smallest window in my garage. It's an old, metal frame window. When I read the description, it seemed like it would fit perfectly after measuring my window. The unit itself fit no problem. The issue was the side panels. It was just like an inch too big horizontally to fit my window. However, I remedied this issue by cutting an inch off of the left and right panel frames. Doing this allowed it to fit perfectly. The height was fine. The screws it comes with are kind of junk, but they work for what you need. Also, the mounting brackets didnt work for me, but again, I have some crazy windowns, apparently. So I made my modifications, installed it, and turned it on. Initially, it made a lot of noise kicking on the first time. Now it's quite quiet. It's blowing out some seriously cold air. I am in the process of insulating my garage (already did the garage doors, working on throwing up the panels on the rafters). I think this is going make working on my cars during the summer exponentially better. I don't know how it will do in the full blown summer yet, but I have high hopes. It will at least be tolerable. I'll update in a few months if anything goes wrong with it. Side note: if you want to insulate your garage with insulation panels, go to Lowes over home depot. I got Poly Pro 3/4"" thick 4' x 8' panels for approx. $15 a piece. Just use a sharp utility knife to cut it and gorilla glue hot glue sticks to mount it to your garage door panels (you'll need to put blocks of the insulation panels on the garage doors before you install your cut panels or else the height won't be right. You'll know what I'm talking about if you go to do it.) Thank me later.

    This was always a pretty average AC unit, but its made terrible by the fact that its designed to stick out your window, however one day of rain and the AC unit no longer produces cold air. In New York it can be 70+ degrees one day and 50 and raining another. This unit was clearly designed for a dry place where its only ever dry heat because any other kind of weather breaks the machine.

    Not ""like new"" as stated, more like ""like fell out window""
  
",2.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,Amazon Customer,评论于 2023年2月13日 在美国 🇺🇸 发布,"







  
  
    I took a chance on the ""like new"" return.  Since other reviews said it had a design fault of not having a drain hole for condensation, I figured I could solve it with a drill if needed.  The description of the one that I selected said the box had cosmetic damage, but that the unit was like new.  Well, the owners manual and installation guide was still wrapped in plastic, unopened.  That was the only part ""like new""1. All the mounting hardware was missing.2. The fresh air vent was broke off and wedged in the fan blades.3. The front looked like it had been pried off, and then the prior owners seem to have tried to reattach it with silicone glue.4. The electrical plug was crushed, with the ground plug broke off.5. The plastic on the inside was covered with paint and silicone.6. The metal cabinet was badly crushed on one side, it looked like it might have fallen out of a window7. Despite the prior owners troubles, they must have got it working for a while, as the filter had a good layer of dog hair (or maybe cat or llama?) covering it. It was also obvious it had been run a while as their was plenty of residue from dried up water in the back, that hadn't drained out.Initially, I was just going to see if I could return it.  But I repair stuff, so I figured I might as well see what it would take to get it running.  I was able to take apart the cabinet, (after scraping illicit silicon of the screw heads) as per the instructions and get the fresh air vent and lever out of the fan blades and back in place. Also, since I had followed the instructions for taking off the front, I was able to get it back together correctly, unlike the prior owners.  The plug is missing the ground plug, clean broke off, but I was able to bend the other prongs into shape enough to plug it in for a brief test.  (I will have to cut the end off and add a new 3 prong repair before actually using it--it would be dangerous to use a metal appliance without a ground!  Unfortunately, this will mean cutting out the GFCI protection at the end of the cord. But I will be plugging it into a GFCI outlet, so that will provide the needed protection.)  After letting it run a while, it did start blowing cold air.  Living in the Pacific Northwest, I only plan to use it a few weeks during the summer. So I guess I will keep it.  But I won't be able to review any other qualities, or lack thereof, until then.

For this year I purchased two more. Theory being together they'll work more efficiently (takes more power to make something cold than to keep it cold).

    I bought this a/c unit for my home gym that has poor air circulation with the home HVAC. At first, it was great. I only put it in the window when I work out so it's not exposed to the elements on any sort of consistent basis. After maybe 40-50 uses, it quit cooling. The fan still runs and it blows air, but it's no longer cooling. It's been very well taken care of, gently removed from the window and stored carefully in between uses. Very disappointing. Another lesson of ""you get what you pay for"". I'll be going with a better brand next time.

    I have had the unit a year and a half.  The touch panel on the unit stop working. I cannot change the mode or adjust the temperature.  The remote control doesn't work either even after installing new batteries.  I usually turn the temperature up during the day and lower it for the night. One day after I set the temperature for 74 during the day I could not lower it to 70 for the night.  Pressing the remote, I am not exaggerating, at least 200 times, I was able to get it down to 72 which is a happy medium for me.  A unit that is less than two years old should not be doing this.

    I live on the 6th floor of a very stuffy and relatively old apartment building in the city so it gets quite hot in the summer, but this AC was a game changer. Super easy to install and very effective. To be honest I haven’t had many AC units so I can’t say a lot about the noise level in comparison to other models, but I did not find it overly loud or bothersome. Zero regrets buying this product!

    Never put a AC window unit in before. It makes some splash noises and scratch noises sometimes when it starts but it goes away after a minute. Remote control is super iffy, it works but it seems out of sync at some times. The remote temp won’t match the number displayed on the unit but it can be synced easily again. Gets my room below room temp so it works. Dehumidifier works great, has an option to just put that on alone, so that’s cool. Unit smelled like fish for a couple days, I don’t know what that was about but it went away and hasn’t come back since, might’ve been on my end. Overall I guess I’m happy with my purchase

    Great product! Energy efficiency is excellent. Rebates might be available through your local power company. My power company gave me a $25 rebate towards my electric bill for this AC unit because it met all the qualifications. The window slider between the inside and outside of the room is pretty thin. I put some insulation and reflective material there to give it more of an R-Value as you can see in the picture. It cools the master bedroom just fine in the deep south which has high humidity. Master bedroom is around 16 feet by 12 feet. It is not loud or noisy, but you can hear it. You will need to buy a bracket of some sort to help hold it in position or else you will risk it falling out onto the ground.

    We purchased it to only cool off the master bedroom. A unit of this size should be able to cool The entire first floor. It was week from the start but it was already installed so we settled for it. Should’ve went with my gut in the beginning and returned it because after two months it stopped blowing cold air. It’s past my return window now so I basically donated money.

     Long story short. Little ac unit works well. I use it to cool a bedroom roughy 144 square feet.The thermostat function really isn't very good at all in my opinion. The thermostat seemed to wait until the room was quite a bit warmer than I'd like before it would start the heat pump, usually it would just be blowing air. Thermostat was also pretty sensitive.  I just left it on the coldest setting and regulated the temperature of the room by opening the bedroom door to different angles.Didn't blow as cold of air as my other 10000 BTU unit, but I didn't expect it to.Air temp on the coldest setting was about 50 degrees Fahrenheit with an outside temperature of 89.

    I bought this due to high reviews overall  and the amount of time the company has been in business,.. but after using it for the past month I can say it does  NOT cool very well and is very noisy .  We are using it in a room 1/3 the size of recommended max sq ft and this is more like a dehumidifier than anything else. I re-read the manual several times hoping I had some setting wrong or something.  We have to turn it to 62 degrees , near max fan &  make sure 'ECO' is OFF to get it to blow cold .Probably the worst A/C unit I've ever owned / used.

    Whenever I want it on or off I just say alexa, turn on air or alexa turn off air. Setting it up with a smart plug and my echo was very easy. This was my first time using a smart plug and Its much more affordable and intuitive than an unneccessarry smart model with the same feaures that cost double or more. If you take any thing away from my review at all it should be this. Even if you decide to buya different air conditioner. DO NOT BUY a smart model. waste of money. buy a smart plug and set it up with your smart hub and feel the power in issuing commands to your humble technical servant.

    Writing this review from the comfort of my 65 degree room while it’s 98 outside. I’m a 5’5” tall woman and I installed this alone without a struggle- getting it out of the box was the biggest challenge. My house is a 1916 Adobe craftsman with small original wood windows and no AC, and this unit was one of the only options that fit its 23” width. That being said, I only used one of the adjustable brackets since it wouldn’t fit with both despite what the measurements on the box said, and I screwed the window bar into the window frame a few extra times to make up for the lack of stabilizing parts that would’ve been on the other side. I also shimmed the unit with popsicle sticks underneath it to get the angle right for water collection as my window wouldn’t let me tilt it and still close it down, so far it seems to be fine. If you’re a light sleeper you’ll need earplugs to run it all night, but it’s not terribly loud, just makes a consistent hum sound. Overall this is a great little unit to keep a small room very cold.

    Happily surprised by how well the 8,000 BTU size cools our living room. It's about 600 sq feet with 10-ft vaulted ceilings, and is poorly insulated. On hot summer days the room reaches 85 degrees and higher. With the AC, it stays at 78. The unit is pretty quiet. (The box fan we used to try to cool off with was a lot louder.) Good value for money. Now we'll just have to see how long it lasts.

    It cools, but it's pretty loud, and is definitely an energy hog like most window AC units. A few weeks into owning it I noticed the styrofoam on the inside of the unit was starting to crack in a certain place. I contacted support who asked me to send a picture of the crack and he would call me back once they received it. I sent the picture IMMEDIATELY and didn't get a call back until the following week. At which point they told me just to return it. Today is the last day of the return window, and I had already thrown away the box it came in. So now I would have to remove it from the window, and find some way to pack it up and send it back. To me it's just not even worth it. I used a bunch of foam insulation that I purchased along with cardboard and air sealing tape to make sure it's a good seal around the ac unit. It's simply too much of a pain to have to remove it and send it back when the unit is working. I'll just continue to use it until it breaks I guess. Midea customer support is terrible, and I won't be purchasing another product from them EVER.

    We ha ent had this unit long enough to know how energy efficient it is and we probably won't have it long enough.The noise level is just almost unbearable. It drowns out the TV so we have to turn it up loud, thus making conversation difficult. At this point it feels like a total waste of money. As far as cooling the area, it just barely covers.We have the bigger one in the back of the house. The U shaped unit and love it. Our plan was to add a new unit to the bedroom as well. But at this point, we wo t be doing that because there would be no way to sleep with this noise. It is ridiculous and if I could get my money back I would. Even if it would be alot of work to pack it back up and return. I am disabled so finding someone to help install was a challenge and then to uninstall would be just as difficult.I am just disappointed amd won't purchase then again, nor would I suggest anyone else do so without really doing your homework first.It is seldom I leave a negative review but it is truly warranted here.

    Pros: Easy to install; installed with another person to ensure safety.The cord is a good length and fits nicely into wall outlet. Blows cold air. Easy to use and sturdy unit.Package came fully intact; no damage to packaging or the unit. All pieces to the unit for insulation was there and direction were easy to follow. Keeps bedrooms nice and cold.Cons: You will hear it running; not terribly noisy but you do know it is on.Overall, it is perfect for cooling bedrooms or similar, smaller, sized areas. I have been pleasantly surprised at the efficiency of this cooling unit. With proper installation it will do the job and cool the room on hot days.Would recommend this AC to others.

    Filter does not clean, impossible to get replacement

    I tried cleaning the reusable filter, but it will not clean. I tried to order a replacement and needed to talk with a time-wasting agent who opened a ""case"" for my request. Not worth the effort. Who knows when or if that will get resolved. Buy a unit with better filters or that lets you use filters from other brands.

It lasted six months, before you jump to maybe something fault or misuse. I’m certified 608/609, I know what happened and the fact that it could do that was defective. But still no response even thou it still falls under their warranty. Buy at your own risk this could of been just my unit but the fact that the company it self will not respond well enough said right.

The unit we replaced that was over 20 years old (that I inherited from my parents) is more quiet than this thing.

    I really don’t like the noise level of this machine, it can be really loud at night and just annoying to listen too. Another thing you might want to consider was the size of the unit. I probably got the wrong size for my room because this unit takes a super super long time to cool down my room even though my room is pretty small, but when it does cool it down it’s super nice. I would consider a bigger unit and one that is quieter if I were to do it again.

    We have window or portable air conditioners in most rooms of our home, ranging from 5k -12k in BTU's. Our other 5k is MUCH colder and has a stronger output than this by far.  The vents on this unit are also fixed, so you can only vary the flow from left to right, NOT up or down (kind of ludicrous)! This is also, hands down the noisiest AC we have!This is a very sub par AC unit, but as the saying in our house goes...it is better than a sharp stick in the eye.

    Way too loud

    I absolutely hate this AC. Bought it to replace a 20 year old unit thinking it would be quieter and more energy efficient. Exceeds db ratings using apple watch and it rattles and makes the worst noises even while on just fan mode. The digital thermostat doesn’t work. That is for the temp of the air coming out which I suppose makes sense. The light stays on all the time such that the room glows at night. And if you change the temperature it beeps loudly to wake up your sleeping partner. I have given  this AC weeks to get used to and while it does cool, is way too loud. I have to cool the room and then put a fan on at night. And I like loud white noise! If it stayed consistently noisy it would be fine. It is terrible with the changing levels if noisy motors. Do not recommend for a bedroom.

    8000 btu Perfect for 16 x 16 uninsulated workshop

    I had worried that at my age of 66 I might not be able to install it by myself. I was wrong thankfully. It was an easy install doing it by the instructions step-by-step. My workshop is a shell only with no ceiling, and this unit cools it down within five minutes and keeps the air temperature well regulated. It is kind of noisy, but for my needs in the shop that doesn’t matter.. Very happy with this purchase!

They are lightweight, made of mold-resistant materials, quiet, and extremely efficient. The moment you turn them on, they produce freezing-cold air. You can set the built-in thermostat to the temp you want, and then walk away and forget about it.Very pleased with Midea air conditioners!

    My main use for it is to cool down the room when it's very hot outside. For that, it does the job. That's why it gets 3 stars. But it loses two stars for being very loud.Too noisy for me, even on low. It would also be nice if it had more accurate temperature control settings, but maybe you don't get that at this price point?

    Had it for a little over a month now.  Does absolute wonders for my living space.  Everything works great.  Noise level can be a bit up there but nothing beyond any other typical A/C.  At least, compared to my old one anyway.  The one thing about the noise that gets me is it sounds like the fan scratches against the back of the foam place in the back.  But it usually only occurs while it's particularly cold.  Not sure what's up with that but it fades away.  At the end of the day, so far, still a 5 star product for me.*update*  Remote stopped working.  Reducing to 4 star.

    I unboxed my brand new Midea AC unit a half hour ago and immediately noticed that the side sliding window adapter piece is broken. I haven't even started to install this yet as I'm going to have to glue this together before I can even start to install the unit.

    Great AC with a terrible DUO hose design
  
",2.0 ,gragus,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 April 11, 2023","







  
  
    The AC itself is great. But the 2-in-1 hose design is terrible. It does not work for locations where the openings are already there, because they are, naturally, made for 2 separate ""normal"" hoses. For people who want to use their existing wall-with-openings setup, this is a deal-breaker.If there is any way to get or make an adapter from this DUO thingy to 2 normal hoses, please provide a pointer!

     The Midea Duo on the surface seems like a good unit. In fact, maybe it is if not for the extremely poor assembly of the electrical components on the one I received. The unit right out of the box, started blowing GFIs on the circuit. After well over $1000 in Electrician visits and parts replacements, we decided the issue is with the GFI on the unit itself.Opened up and find frayed power conductors - and not enough current carrying capacity because the strands are broken.So put a normal cord on there and got rid of the GFI on it  and wouldn’t you know it it actually functions correctly when the wires are not destroyed in the first place.Not only was this thing, a fire hazard the way it came out of the box, but a complete waste of everyone’s time.

Despite the room being 35° and my maxing out the temp and cycling through every mode this thing has for half an hour (with 3 - 10 minute pauses between), when I got out of bed to get ready for work the room was 37°The app is also terrible, all the text is in an Asian language for a good 10 - 15 seconds when you boot it up, it defaults to Celsius and you have to revert it to F EVERY TIME YOU OPEN THE APP, and none of the functions actually work as far as I could tell.Very much not recommended, when it decides it wants to work it's fine (hence the two stars), but I do not trust it to heat or cool my room one bit, and for $700 this is a laughably bad deal.

    Fantastic. Quiet, powerful, easy to use and setup. The adapters could have been a little better, but it's a minor quibble.I am using this in a Florida room in Florida that is typically akin to a greenhouse. There is zero insulation, a metal roof, and the thing was always warm even WITH other AC's running. I decided to try this one - and let me tell you, it's a miracle. The room is icy cold midday with the sun beating down and the temperature outside 96 degrees.It runs quiet, uses less electric than the previous units, and is simple to use and program. I couldn't be happier with it.

    Heat and cool:Both work very well. Heat works best when it is warmer, but will still work when it is cold outside. The manual says that the heat does not work below 40F, but I had it it running at 20F and it worked great. Cool blows out very cold air.Noise:It can get noisy on high but on low, it is very quiet. Unit has an inverter fan and maybe compressor. Fan speed can be ajusted though the app (1%-100% and also low med hi), but on the remote and unit it is only Low Med High. Doesn't bother me too much though. It also has auto speed which I don't know which fan speed selction it uses.Remote:The remote annoys me. Not the thing itself, but how it oporates. When I cahange a setting on the remote, everything is fine. But when I change a setting on the unit, it does not change on the remote. This is very anoying because then I have to go through all the fan speeds or cylcle power on the remote ans hopefuly not short cylcle the unit. Other than that, the remote is great.Overall:Overall the unit was worth 700$. It keeps me warm and cool and has good controls. Does not make water very often, which is nice. Other than the remote, the unit is great.

    This unit is compact, has wheels, a nice strong cord and plug-in, and is powerful for its size. It cools a normal-sized room quickly (with a window exhaust), and it dehumidifies a normal-sized room quickly as well. The best part is, unlike most models, this one does NOT need a window vent to dehumidify. It has a water release nozzle on the very bottom, making releasing water captured out of the air in your room very easy to empty. You do NOT have to empty the water with each used, but only after it builds up in the catch basin. Overall, this is great unit. It is heavy, so the wheels come in handy. If you have carpeting, sorry, but it will be hard to wheel around. If you have flat hard-surface floors you are in luck.

    First off the item arrived in a box beat up and old covered in dust. No bottom to the box just the styrofoam bottom and everything held together with shipping straps. Which meant when it came time to return it, I had no way to seal it. So I had to stuff everything into a wardrobe box and use a half a roll of tape because this thing is heavy.So just be aware that should you have to return this item, you better have your own box ready. Unless I just got some random piece of inventory that they did this too.The first two nights it worked very well. It cooled off our bedroom and it ran all night. The next night I woke up in the morning and it was no longer blowing air. The fan had turned off. I cycled the power and it started running again only to cut off a few hours later. The power stayed on but the fan stopped blowing air. The duration by which this thing would stay on would get smaller and smaller. To the point that by day four, it would only stay on for about 10 minutes before cycling off. It was not set to timer nor was it set to auto. It was set to high fan and cool with the timer off. I would have loved for this thing to work because it did cool off our room for the two days that it actually worked. But man what a complete pain in the butt it was to try to return this thing.

    Haven't gotten to test the cooling function but I bought it because it's supposed to heat the room. The heat function blows semi warm air and will get a room to somewhat warm but stops functioning if it gets below 40°f which kinda defeats the purpose of buying such an expensive product. Beyond that, it's a gorgeous unit and the remote and app functionality are cool but the mounting equipment are to be desired and don't stay put very well. Ultimately I'll be returning it for a refund because not heating the room is a deal breaker

    This machine works great, but I live in a humid environment and the water tray is very small. It builds up sludge very quickly due to this and there is no way to access the water tray to fix the issue.  If you remove the exhaust hose you can maybe drop a tablet in there if you have good aim, but its very difficult and did not resolve my issue. As such about once a month I have to go outside and backwash the drain hole with water to attempt to dislodge and break up the sludge. This is sadly only temporary and very time consuming. I attempted to contact their support but they refused to help me at all and constantly asked for irrelevant information that I still supplied until eventually ignoring my request for support stating I had no warranty.I have attempted to resolve the issue myself by disassembling the unit but even with 100% of all screws removed it is still attached in multiple ways that are not intuitive or known, the last thing I want to do is break the device.So the rating is greatly lowered due to inability to resolve this issue and complete lack of support.

    I bought this because I live in a rental in Texas which is a very old and poorly insulated house. We do have central air but it costs a fortune to run and struggles with the Texas heat. The Midea is for a bedroom that's only about 300 square foot, which sounds like overkill but my old 10k BTU Black and Decker had trouble cooling to 80 on our 100 degree + days. This unit should also be cheaper to run since it's much more energy efficient.I really wanted the extra BTUs for cooling more than I wanted the heater but I'm already making use of it thanks to a brief late February cold snap.  I had accidentally set it to automatic mode while setting it up and very quickly realized it had warmed my room up, now I'm really glad I got the Duo. Before when we would have big temperature swings at night I'd have to go to sleep with the AC set to 72 and a space heater set to 66, otherwise I'd either go to bed sweating or wake up freezing. Now I've got one unit that keeps my room at 72 all night despite the wild temperature swings outside.As far as noise goes The Midea has a much more powerful fan so naturally, that is louder but it's compressor is actually much quieter than the Black and Decker.. no more loud buzzing when the AC kicks on.I'll try to update this review once we start getting 100-degree weather and I see how it handles Texas summers.

    I am late with this review so my apologies.  I wanted to see how it turned out.  Out of the box it worked fine, a few weeks later it stopped working.  The service department gave me a few things to try, none of the suggestions worked so we agreed to refund the purchase price and they did not want to pay for shipping it back.  The refund never arrived.  So I had a local AC shop look at it.  A simple fix but it cost $150.  Also it was supposed to be a heat pump.  It's not.  I do not recommend it just because the company does not back it up.  Count on having to pay someone to fix it, so add $150 for repairs.  Also do not expect a heat pump.  After all that and paying someone to fix it, it has performed well as an AC since them and it works with Alex most of the time.

    Saves Me In The Summer!

    Where I live, only brand new houses have air conditioning in them and it has started to get really hot in the summers.  I bought this to put in my bedroom and help cool it down and it does a great job!  It's a little loud of course, but its not terrible.  Also its really nice to have the ability to somewhat put it where ever I want instead of have to make sure the window isn’t blocked by anything.  I would definitely recommend it for anyone to cool down one particular room!

    This unit is sturdy, powerful, and quiet.  Set up was easy and the large sheets of adhesive foam made a good seal, and looked from inside and outside.  The app is great and allows for remote controlling and scheduling!  It didn't make it through the whole summer so I contacted customer support and sent the error codes from the app.  They were very eager to assist  and quick to uphold the warranty without any push back or surprises.  I also have a different midea ac which is a beast... I think I just got a dud for this one.  Overall the workmanship is good and I am a happy customer.  The only feedback would be to allow the fan setting to vent outside air in for those cool nights.  Would purchase again.

    I bought this from amazons warehouse because it just said “like new” and that *just* the box would be damaged. There were other ones available that stated it was missing a remote or had cosmetic damage. Well guess which one I got…it has huge gauges on it, there’s a bunch of lint/hair in the filter, it’s missing the manual and remote AND I turned it on and it didn’t even work. The only option is to take it to UPS or have UPS come pick it up and then wait 2 weeks for a refund. I can’t attest if it’s a good machine or not because Amazon did me dirty.

    We are very disappointed in this item.  When we bought it, the air conditioning portion worked pretty good.  It is loud but we managed thru that.  When it came time to switch to the heat function a few months later, it does not work and is VERY, VERY loud.  We have tried to get our money back or exchange it.  The company is giving us the run around.  They say a refund check has been mailed but 2 and half weeks later, nothing.  When calling customer service, they tell us we need to wait a bit longer for a new check.  Says the mail can take 3-4 weeks.  What a joke.  A very expensive item.  We just want our money back.

    I am not sure this duo portable heater is any good for heating, especially when it starts getting extremely cold (say 20F to 30F). Initially there was no obvious error as to why my heating on this unit suddenly stopped. I got curious to check the mobile app and decided to run a check on the Unit - I found out that there was one abnormal result of the 113 checks that completed.abnormal check - cold wind protection (p9). As there is no useful information on the app, I decided to check online and still nothing, so I'm assuming that the system has somehow disabled the heating feature because it senses cold air entering the unit and hence becoming inoperable (in heating mode) possibly to protect the refrigerant or something

    During a recent failure of our building's central AC, our small server room hit 106 degrees F.  The surrounding rooms were 85 F with no heat on.  Uncomfortable for us and bad for the servers!We put this in there, ducted it to the room's one small window, set it to 80 degrees, and turned it on.An hour later, it was down to 95 F in the server room.  When we returned the next morning, it was 80 degrees in there, and the surrounding rooms were back to 72 F.Disaster averted!Compared to many others, the real advantage of this unit is that the duct is split between intake and outflow.  Meaning it has two loops internally.  One from and to the room and the second from and to the outside.  It exchanges the heat from the room loop to the outside loop and then sends the air from each back where it came from.This means it cools highly efficiently without creating negative pressure in the room by exhausting hot air outside without replacing it.This doesn't cool as much as central AC but costs less to operate.  For those times of year (spring and fall) when we only need AC because of the server room, this may save us money!If this thing can cool 2.5kW of servers and switches, it ought to do a pretty good job in any household application.The one thing I really can't weigh in on is the noise level; that room already has a ""hearing protection required to enter"" sign on the door.If I could change one thing, I would make the included duct longer.  But given our niche use, that's probably not an issue for most people.

    This item arrived on time as expected. It is heavy but easy to install. I should have ordered one with 10,000BTUS, but it managed to cool a slightly larger room area than it recommended. The room was never cold (nor do I like it that way). It was always comfortably cool, compared to the outdoors. It drained about 1-1/2 gallons of water into a bucket every 3-4hrs. on very warm days. So, I'd only run it (or set the timer) when I would be home to empty the bucket. I wouldn't say this unit runs EXTREMELY loud, but it isn't ""quiet,"" either. Imagine the outside part of a window AC being in the house. If you're working at home, watching TV, or listening to anything else, it's distracting...but unavoidable. My overall critique is that a portable AC unit is meant to cool a single room, not an entire home. I accept that and limit myself to just one room. My goal is to stay nice and comfy, while I manage several chronic health issues. Considering the last summer with 90+degree weather, which melted my window blinds, having this portable device is much better than trying to sleep with no AC.

    Man, I was really really hopeful when I found this unit. Seemed like it was exactly what I needed, heat/AC in one unit. AC worked great all summer, temps got over 100 several times. The major problem is the heating ability, the majority of the country gets below 45 degrees in the winter. The heater simply won't work when it is below that which renders it completely useless making me use a separate space heater in the small building. This is a side the fact that my unit wouldn't pump the water out and was leaking making me go through a replacement process. I will be searching for another option. Pretty disappointing. Purchased through Lowe's but I know everyone reads reviews on Amazon.

Once the temperature gets to 45°F the heater will struggle to blow hot air, and after the temperature gets to 41°F the heat pump will not start at all. The unit was designed to function this way.This unit also struggles to blow cold air once the temperature gets above 88°F, but the unit will continue to operate regardless of how hot it gets outside.Do not purchase this unit if you plan to use it in temperatures beyond the operating temperature range, because it simply cannot do it. In my experience, it seems to be more sensitive to the temperature inside the hose than the temperature inside the room. If I heat up the room with a separate heater the heat pump still will not engage if the outside temperature is out of operating range.

    The hose is a bit stiff. I am use to indoor ground units to have a hose that is much easier to control but with that said if you want a very good, strong, and quiet unit this is it. I wanted to right a pun like I was blown away by it's power, Honesty I live in Arizona and this summer was a breeze with this thing and it was my only source of air conditioning.

    I like how easy the set up was and the multiple ways of controlling the unit. I especially like that even of I'm not on the wifi network, that I can still control the unit from anywhere. One of the things I don't like is the fan speed. I feel it's pretty slow even at its highest setting. I wish there was a way to make it a little stronger. Also, having the vent point at its lowest setting, reduces the fan speed. I also feel that the coldest setting isn't that cold. Even for a room slightly smaller than its max capacity, it has a hard time keeping the room cold. On the hottest day, the ac unit felt like it was struggling to keep up. I'm sure if the room was a lot smaller, it would probably work fine. I gave it a 3 star rating mostly because of how much I liked the controls. And the Alexa feature is awesome.

    Would be 5 star except it leaks in outside air defeating the purpose of a dual hose system
  
",2.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,WARPed,评论于 2022年10月23日 在美国 🇺🇸 发布,"







  
  
    I'd love to be able to recommend this unit. It is generally quiet (can get temporarily loud at random times which is bad in a bedroom overnight), has good features, a great remote, and sips power (relatively) but the unit is poorly sealed and as a result outside air easily enters your home via the intake hose when the unit is off, and when it is on it sucks air from your home to blow out the exhaust causing negative pressure and external air to be sucked in from other ingress points around the home.I have two of these units purchased 4 months apart. When I owned the first one it was installed in such a location that the negative pressure was not noticeable but when I brought a second unit and placed it in my bedroom I noticed it would pull the door open if not properly latched when the AC was turned on. Glad of the cool air and happy with the other features I put it to the back of my mind until the wildfire season came and the stink billowed out both units horribly. Placing my nose near the rear body vent it became clear that the smell was entering via the intake hose when the unit was off. I also noticed that on cooler nights a cold draft would drift from the same vents.I removed the dual hose from the unit to investigate and noticed large dust deposits around the poorly sealing areas around where the hose mates to the AC body. Flashing a flashlight around I also realized that the holes in the back of the unit for the plug to sit in go directly into the external air chamber allowing another place for air to mix. Similarly more holes further down the back of the unit do the same. Shine a flashlight around the underside and you will see light shine up unimpeded into the external air chamber. The hole in the bottom where the power cable exits is so large I can fit a whole finger in it (as well as the power cable) and that too goes straight into the external air chamber.In short, while I have no doubt this unit creates much less negative pressure issues than a single hose unit if you are expecting to keep outside air out (including pollution and smells) this unit will fail you miserably. It defeats one of the main selling points. It makes it useless as a heater in the winter as so much cold air will seep into the house defeating another major selling point. I'm sad I paid so much for a system that is so poorly designed and built. Remember, I have two of these unit and both are the same. They were purchased 4 months apart so this is not a one off or a problem with a specific lot.  It has a great feature set but this takes all that away. Wish I'd never brought them.

    Easy set up & quickly effective
  
",5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,Rebecca R,评论于 2022年10月19日 在美国 🇺🇸 发布,"







  
  
    This is perfect for what I needed & well worth my investment. I have a small bedroom with a window that requires vertical placement of the hose. In order to adjust the window insert, a saw was required. I opted to skip this step, as the space left by leaving the second piece out was no more than half an inch & I didn't want to fuss with it. The unit cools my space almost immediately and while there is some noise, I did not find it bothersome & in fact, it provided some nice extra white noise for sleeping. The remote control is also very handy, but the temp on the unit & the temp on the control sometimes read differently. I can decrease the temp on the remote to 72, but the unit doesn't respond & will still read 74. I find that if I make sure the remote is aiming straight for the unit, this happens less frequently. It's much like using a TV remote, it can't have anything blocking the remote and the receiver. Also, because it is portable, when my landlord sent out a notice that on October 1st all window units needed to be taken down, I didn't have to remove mine. I could continue to use it when the days were still warm. Overall, I'm super glad I made the choice to purchase this air conditioner and would recommend it to anyone looking for a simple set up unit that really works & doesn't break your bank.

    Thoughts on the Midea Duo 14,000 BTU after two months of ownership
  
",5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,Taj,评论于 2022年10月8日 在美国 🇺🇸 发布,"I waited a couple of months to see how the experience held up before submitting a review. Before purchase I had wondered about the drainage situation, performance, and overall noise level. I can address these points fully now.

The Midea Duo is a wonderful machine -- in a small bedroom (roughly 11x11) setting this to the lowest setting (60 degrees Fahrenheit) will actually take a space this small down into the mid / upper 50s. This is while the machine copes easily with southeastern heat and humidity outside.

I watched a Youtube reviewer test the noise level, and yes, that very low decibel rating is accurate with one caveat. The minimum noise level advertised only happens on low fan when the unit is in air circulation mode, no AC active -- the compressor running will easily exceed that level even on the lowest settings.

Don't get me wrong -- I work at a desk approximately four feet away from the unit and I have absolutely no issues doing my job. There is a quirk of the unit where when the AC first activates, it briefly will spin everything up to maximum even with the settings configured to low / medium. This will last about thirty seconds before the inverter tech kicks in and the compressor drops into background noise. This is my only pet peeve overall.

I am unsure as to why there isn't a ""quiet mode"" setting where it will run the compressor at a low setting more often for longer periods to maintain temperature versus needing to run full power for a bit. I would absolutely love this as a feature. Sending the compressor all the way to maximum and maximum fans briefly before stepping back and operating quietly is annoying, but I will note that I do not consider this loud enough to interrupt my day. Sitting further away will mitigate the issue completely.

The noise is never enough to wake me from sleep and isn't ""terrible"". On normal low AC settings outside of the initial ""start up"" where it runs full tilt, I would say it is about as loud as box fan set to medium-low. The full start up level of noise for the compressor is approximately as loud as a window AC running on full. You will definitely notice the different stages as it cycles up and down.

This thing will freeze you out of a room and quickly drop the temperature. I have never seen anything like it. Even dealing with Florida heat and humidity it was able to take a heat soaked room that was in the upper 80s down to the low 70s in a span of two hours.

I had some concerns about needing to drain this vs a comparable Whynter unit with their exhaust technology. Those concerns were unfounded -- even with Florida humidity I have never needed to drain the unit. I have checked multiple times but I have never had more than a few drops of water in the tank. The AC exhausts the water vapor efficiently out through the window and does not seem to accumulate much at all.

I have not needed to use the dehumidifying option, so that option may require more draining. For normal AC use you will probably not need to drain it often at all. If you live in a drier climate than Florida, you will probably never need to give draining it a second thought at all.

Installation was not difficult for one person and all needed adapters / panels are provided. Midea supplies extra panels and adapters in case you need extensions. I do recommend reviewing the instructions and using the dampening foam panels to keep outside noise and heat away. You can install it without the instructions (it's that simple) but your life will be much easier if you read the manual. :) Make sure to install the hose flow separator at the end of the vent or your performance will not be as great.

Once the foam is installed and the window secured with the included foam liners, outside noise is no worse than what it was before with the window closed. Midea has done very well in thinking of customer comfort.

Durability -- it cools just as well as it did on day one. It has, however, developed a very annoying rattle/vibration when the compressor spins up and goes to full power. This sounds like something vibrating loose in the unit and this happened a few weeks into ownership.

If I press my hand to the side of the unit this is goes away, so perhaps some piece of sound insulation has let go internally? I do not know if it is a defect since it is cooling perfectly, but I had to take away from the noise level stars because this is annoying and something I notice daily. Before it started doing this vibration-rattle the unit was much quieter.

Purely fan mode is wonderfully quiet, so I know this has to be coming from the compressor somehow.

Make sure to clean and check the filters, as the mesh is very fine and this unit needs the airflow to operate at best performance. I have not needed to use the heat function since we're still in the upper 80s and 90s, but will update as I use it.

The remote control is good for when you don't want to get out of bed to change settings, but I find the app to be easier to use. The remote can do most of the things the buttons on the unit will do minus a few options that require the unit buttons to be held down. The app will let you fine tune most settings on the unit and select fan speeds beyond low, medium, or high. I would like to see full control from the app with all settings that can be adjusted on the unit itself.

Our power bill did not increase by much using the AC. Part of this is probably helped by the Midea taking some of the strain off of the old (and inefficient) wall units here. I normally leave it set to low fan circulation and around 72 degrees on the AC. It uses much less power than a comparable window unit and I would absolutely not have anything other than an inverter driven AC at this point. The technology is that good.

Would I buy another Midea again? Absolutely. There are improvements they can make to the overall build quality (addressing the various vibrations / rattles that have appeared) and settings (a quiet AC mode would be greatly appreciated), but overall this is very comparable with the best that Whynter has to offer and the thoughtfulness of the app is wonderful.

It is not cheap, but the price gives you a tremendous performance and feature combination. I have no doubt that this would cool a large living room or combined space with ease. Thank you to Midea for saving me from Florida Summer!

Edit and followup: I attached two decibel measurements. The average for medium fan is 54 and the average for the unit running in AC mode is 61 with spikes up to 68.

I finally ran the heat and it works great, though it will collect a lot of humidity as condensation in the trays. The unit is very easy to drain, but you can also switch to dry mode to have the unit evaporate and exhaust the water.","颜色: 黑色//白色尺寸: 14,000 BTU with Heat","颜色: 黑色//白色尺寸: 14,000 BTU with Heat",https://www.amazon.com/MAP08R1CWT-Portable-Conditioner-Dehumidifier-control/product-reviews/B087CQVC9G/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_paging_btm_next_7?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&pageNumber=7

    First, this is a 70lb unit.  It is heavy.  Second it works great for sash windows and sliding aluminum but has no adapter for french type side hinged windows.  Having said that, this is one nice unit.  It is quiet,  My last floor model shook the house and the fan was very noisy.  This one does not even disturb dinner from 8 feet away.  I don't know the decibels but they must be around 50 or so.  Quiet.  And it cools the place down.  I used it in a 1400 sq ft two br apartment with a 900 sq foot living room and dining area.  The apartment is 2nd floor and very warm.  This morning it was topping 85 at 9 am.  We installed this AC and blocked the window opening with the lightproof curtains to reduce the heat and force the hot air out.  Within 1/2 hour the temp inside the living room area was 72.  Wow.  That is a lot of area to cool.  But it did and it even cycled.  Bought another.  Love the heating too.  Saves gas big time.

     The unit itself is quiet, well designed, and functions well, as described in other reviews here. My main issues are with the window hardware and duct. The window mount and adapter is not sturdy enough and the clips that hold the parts together are not strong enough. My basement install reaches the limit of the exhaust duct length, so it applies a bit of force to the mounting clips. This scenario should be expected for this type of unit. The clips have a tendency to pop out constantly. The vertical adapter required for my sliding windows adds another set of weak clips that can pop out, causing additional grief. And that vertical adapter cannot fit into a vertical window with bulky trim around it without modification (tough to explain - see video). The window is now an obvious security risk since everything can be pushed in easily to access the window. Once everything is in place and settled, this unit has worked very well for cooling my ~550 sq. ft. space. I'll have to update my review with my experience using the heating function after the winter months.

    Cools Like a Beast, but Doesn't Dehumidify.
  
",3.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,Lonnie Christopher,评论于 2022年9月25日 在美国 🇺🇸 发布,"







  
  
    First-day use impressions: It cools like a beast and works way better than our previous portable AC. Powerfan and cooling with lots of automated options and controls via phone app, remote, or Alexa.  The only negative thing I have to say about it is that I have not been able to get the dry mode to lower humidity at all. It doesn't seem to do anything in DRY mode more than it does in Cool mode. There is no drainage at all in DRY mode, in fact, nothing changes when I switch between Cool and Dry. I thought the fan was supposed to slow down, but it doesn't. The dry mode was one of the main reasons why I bought this unit so for that I had to subtract a few stars. I'll contact support on Monday to see if something is wrong with the unit and update you.Update: I contacted support and they had no real solutions and told me that I have to disconnect the hose from the outside vent in DRY mode!?!?!?, which I tried, and then it just heated up the room and didn't dry any better. This seems like a huge design flaw and had I known it I probably wouldn't have purchased it Their only suggestion was to return it, and that seems like a huge hassle, but may be best.Six-month update: It still works like a beast and I can attest that it uses much less energy than my last unit. The biggest issue I have found so far is the plastic clips that connect the hose to the window piece are plastic. I have broken two of them already and I don't see how they wouldn't break fairly easily after a few times connecting and disconnecting the hose. Plan on replacing this piece every few years. These should have been made of stronger materials. Being that this connection is a very crucial part of its function I am lowering my score another star. If it can't connect to the window it basically useless.

    Window kit is awful. AC itself is good (but useless without good window kit)

    I would have given this AC 5 stars if the window adapter wasn’t such an awful piece of junk. The adapter piece is very stiff and when we were connecting it, the attachment piece snapped clean off. We read other reviews that complained about the window kit so we were very careful and it still broke. I contacted the manufacturer and they sent me a link to purchase a replacement piece  for $80 (and $10 shipping so $90 total). We tried to tape it, but it just wouldn’t hold so we caved and ordered the replacement. Hopefully it doesn’t break a second time. The whole window panel piece just isn’t very sturdy. Definitely prepare to get creative with installation if you do make this purchase.The AC itself is great, except that you can’t really turn it or have it stand at an angle because the hose is very stiff and it needs to stand right where your window opening is. But it’s quieter than our other AC and cools our room well.Bottom line: I would have rather just paid $100 extra from the beginning if it meant the window kit would be good quality. Overall, I’m glad we got this AC. Just hoping the manufacturer listens to feedback and improves the window kit.

    This has made our small apartment survivable during an extended hot summer.  A single-hose portable AC is never as efficient as a 2-hose or window unit, and won't cool as much -- that is the nature of them.  But this is equal to others I've used.  It's not quite, but it's not the noisiest I've heard either.  The hose is easy to attach (and remove from) the back of the unit, and to the outlet at the other end:  no hose clamps to mess with.

    I am not allowed to have a window unit in my condo building, and getting a PTAC was looking to be at least 8k because of some electrical and structural issues. I was using a portable AC from Toshiba, but it was so loud and barely cooled me while blowing straight on me. I saw a good review for this unit and so far it has been an answer to my prayers. It is really quiet and cools my studio apartment well. I have not used the heat function yet, but I hope that will also be helpful. It's a bit bulky and I wish that it came in white, but its definitely much better than spending 8k or dealing with my old portable ac.

    Thermastat is poorly designed
  
",3.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,Jacob Trenta,评论于 2022年9月6日 在美国 🇺🇸 发布,"







  
  
    This unit came highly recommended by various internet review sites, but my experience with it has been frustrating.  The thermastat seems to measure the temperature of the outside air rather than the inside air.  Our bedroom often stays warm even as the outside cools down, so the unit will often be off as the temperature inside goes several degrees past the setpoint.  There is an app for this unit, which will conveniently tell you the temperature the unit is sensing.  I have an indoor thermometer and these two temperatures are often very different.  There is a feature that allows you to control off of the temperature at the remote instead of the unit, but this feature only works as long as the remote stays connected to the unit, which it will not do for more than 10 minutes rendering that feature useless.  The result is we have to control the unit semi-manually by either raising or lowering the setpoint to extremes.  Incidentally, we have similar unit from a different manufacturer (identical chassis - probably the same hardware with different circuit board) and it has the same issue.  It also has a high pitched squeal when it starts the compressor up, so if it does kick on and off at night while you sleep, hope you're a deep sleeper.

    I love this ac. It is easily the best I have owned. Being able to remotely turn the ac on and off is great. It also cools down quickly, our room was 83 and within 30 minutes it had the temp down to 63. It is 112 today and the ac is easily keeping the room at 70. It also notifies you when the filter needs cleaned or it needs to be drained. And you can turn off the button noises and lights. The negatives are it is kind of noisy. Unlike other ac's it does not keep the fan running the fan only comes on when the compressor is running. So when the fan engages it is often at full speed and it is a bit loud all of the sudden and sometimes it makes this beeping activation type noise that reminds me of r2d2. Since the remote contains the temperature sensor, so you have to think about where you place it. No matter where I place it, it doesn't match the Alexa air quality temperature sensor and sometimes I have to turn it off and back on again to get it to run when the room is hotter than it reports. But even having said all that I would buy this unit again. And plan on doing so when my other ac dies.

    This air conditioner rumbles like a jet plane taking off every time it kicks on. We even put a board under it to see if it helps. You can get used to that though, what I hate the most though is the way the filter is designed. It’s not easy to clean, there are a billion little plastic pieces creating little jails for dirt to collect in. You have to take it off and use a toothbrush as a little broom to clean each lil jail cell. Then as if this wasn’t enough of a pain, you have the swap that collects in the bottom of this thing. I can’t even figure out why or how it’s collecting water when I don’t use the dehumidifier portion. Regardless, every other day, a new swap has formed in the bottom. I was ready to accept this lil droids flaws of it could quell the infernal hell that was my room, but alas, it could not. Hell is roughly 200 sq ft with 2 doors to minimize some of that area and this lil droid, set at 63 degrees, can’t even manage to keep it a solid 68 degrees. Don’t waste your money on this. It my humble opinion, this is not the droid you are looking for.

We live in a very mild climate so only really use it when there is a heat wave in the summer. Called Midea customer service and they offer zero support, no advice on how to fix it, no resources at all. Apparently if it was still within the 1-year warranty they would offer an exchange. Very disappointing considering this is a $600 product.I tried emptying the water tray (it was already empty though), tried unplugging it and leaving it unplugged for 10-15 minutes, even multiple days, but plugging it back in and it still does not respond. There is no error message, it just is completely dead. Very very disappointing.

    The product itself works well enough, but the instructions and support are terrible. The instructions tell you to attach the adhesive foam to your window frame, and like an idiot, I followed the instructions. This makes the ""portable"" AC no longer portable since it now has to be in that one place, and you won't be able to move it to another place without buying additional adhesive foam, which the manufacturer will not supply.Instead what I should have done was to attach the adhesive foam to the slider itself so that it can be moved around or put away without putting a punch of sticky gunk on my window frame.I contacted Midea's customer support and they blamed me for following their instructions (which they also included in the video on the Amazon page), and wanted to charge me for an entire installation kit even though all I needed was replacement adhesive foam.

    Good option if window unit is impractical
  
",4.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,Edward Turpin,评论于 2022年8月28日 在美国 🇺🇸 发布,"







  
  
    This is the best portable AC I've found/used. My previous portable AC with the same ASHRAE BTU rating could only keep my room 10 degrees cooler than outdoors, which was unacceptable since we had 3 solid months of >100F weather this year. This unit can keep my room at least 18F degrees cooler than outdoors. I think the dual-hose design really helps. I think to get any better cooling performance you would have to get a window AC unit, which could get you ~3000 more BTU on a normal 15-amp, 120v outlet.This AC is also much quieter than my previous portable. Not as quiet as a newer, quality window unit, but close to it on the lowest setting. I think this unit uses a variable speed compressor motor, making it quieter and more efficient than ACs without.I do not like the remote control. It's very large. It has an LCD display that is supposed to show things like the mode and temperature set-point, but it will sometimes get of of sync with the AC unit (if you use the controls on the unit itself, or the AC unit didn't receive the IR signal from the remote).I haven't tried the heating function out yet, so can't comment on that. I plan on using it this winter, so I hope it works well.In conclusion, if a window AC is impractical for whatever reason (window location/type not suitable), this is a solid choice.

    Rating was based on comparison to other portable units.This is the best performing portable unit you can get.  I have no qualms in saying that.  I have only really tried cooling with it, but it does everything I would expect out of an inverter unit.  It ramps down and oscillates at the set temperature.  Much more efficient than full on or full off.As with all inverter units, the rating is not what it actually is.  This is probably more of a 10000 btu unit.  But it does a good job.Havent had any issues with drainage, but its dry here in Southern Utah.This really is a unique design.  It's a mini split in a portable package.  Cant wait to try heat out.  I will update once I start using the heat.

    Powerful, quiet, efficient

    Bought an equivalent HiSense unit that sounded like a jet taking off and failed to cool my 500sqft space. This thing is super quiet, cools the space with ease, and readily integrated with Alexa. My only gripe is Alexa can't set the fan speed back to auto. Setup was simple, and the unit came with adhesive insulation for the window, window insert, and an insulated sleeve for the hose further boosting efficiency. My monthly AC cost dropped by about 20% or more compared to the other unit.UPDATE: Discovered today the heat function shuts off below 41 F to protect the coil from frost. Where I live fall sees nighttime temperatures dip below freezing often and it's unacceptable to have the heater shut off when its needed most. I'm trying to delay firing up my boiler with oil costs. This product is falling well short of my expectations for its heating function. Proper air source heat pumps briefly turn on the AC to thaw the coil then switch back to heat. They don't let their customers freeze.

    Still pulls in outside air, contrary to the marketing
  
",2.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,CM,评论于 2022年8月25日 在美国 🇺🇸 发布,"







  
  
    This unit does indeed pull in outdoor air. Even with the unit off, if you put your hand near the vents beneath where the hose connects to the unit, you'll feel a strong amount of airflow. Heck, you'll feel it strongly around all the drain ports - even all along the base of the unit! I was having quite a bit of trouble figuring out why this was having so much trouble with lowering the relative humidity below 60% - now I figured it out. I don't live in a particularly humid climate. If you're thinking of using this to keep your bedroom below 68 degrees while sleeping, then best of luck - it certainly will accomplish this, but it will absolutely struggle to reduce the RH below 60%. It regularly hovers at 65% throughout the night according to both of my sensors, even with my central AC kicking in every so often for ventilation. Tried running it on dry mode with the hose draining outside, and it still can't keep up. You do not want your indoor relative humidity level to reach above 60% as it introduces a whole host of issues, both to you health and your home. Was also wondering why my allergies were flaring up. I also live adjacent to a busy street, and I ultimately prefer to not have a continuous airflow of car exhaust into my home. Had I known this, I wouldn't have purchased this unit. I just do not understand why Midea makes such an outrageously incorrect claim. Now, I have to go through the hassle of returning this unit - already had to fabricate a custom mount to fit my sliding door that took a lot of time and effort to effectively weather seal before I figured this out, so yeah, I've wasted a monumental amount of time trying to find an adequate cooling solution. Unfortunately, this isn't it. Midea, please change your marketing and make it clear that this does, in fact, introduce outdoor air whilst the unit is running and while it is off/not runningOh, and I just remembered that I've been having a moth problem - I was thinking at first that it was the from the unit since I was finding them underneath and around it, but how could that be? The hose system is sealed after all... Hahaha, no it's not. So you are also taking a chance on allowing insects in. Great!I spent an unhealthy amount of time researching portable ACs before getting this. Thought it was going to be perfect, but alas, it has a glaring problem that's a result of lazy engineering. And this issue extends beyond merely introducing outdoor air - because the air appears to infiltrate throughout the internals, this is absolutely going to shorten the lifespan of it. There is no way you're going to be able to effectively clean it. And once you look in the hoses after running it for just a week, you'll find it's absolutely filthy. You can extrapolate that the inside must be in a similar condition since the airpath is not isolated in any sense; it is just marketing garbage.Wish I had spent all of this time just installing a mini split - lots of ones that are DIY and come pre-charged are around the price of this. I suppose that's really the only way to ensure that you're not circulating outdoor air.

    If you live anywhere with high humidity this is not the AC for you. Because it pulls in air from outside the process of cooling it dehumidifies the air. Where I live this fills the half liter drain pan in about 30 minutes where I live. I also found out that the pump used in the dehumidify mode does not kick in in cool mode so you need to get the unit high enough off the ground to let gravity do the work. If you don't, once the drain pan is full the unit stops cooling to prevent the drain pan overflowing, however my unit leaked no matter how empty the pan was.I'm sure it's great for dry areas, just be aware in humid ones.

    Got this unit after reading a positive review on Wirecutter.  Overall, very impressed.PROS:Very quiet.  Sound level is comparable to the ""fan only"" setting on my other portable AC (Black+Decker 8K BTU) and no jarring compressor start/ stop.Good hose design.  Dual hose stays cooler than single.  In addition, the up-facing outlet is easier to route to window-level, allowing the unit to be closer to the wall (usually the hose comes straight out of the back, so the unit has to sit further into the room)Blows ice cold.  No issues with power or temp, cools well (note that my room is 300 sq feet)Nice mobile app.  You can turn the AC on remotely (say, 10 mins before you arrive) so you can come home to a cool living room.CONS:Some water leakage.  After running it for several super hot, humid days, there was a little puddle next to it (a teaspoon or so).  So you need to drain it after extreme humidity days, though I've had zero water drain out (or leak) since then, even after many days of use.Doesn't (completely) solve the negative pressure issue.  Portable ACs suck air from other parts of your house.  This unit draws less surrounding air than my B+D, but it's not 100%.  I keep a small window crack in my other room to bring in fresh air (but that of course reduces efficiency of the cooling).Black Darth Vader styling.  Like Darth, it dominates the room.  Doesn't look bad, but I would have preferred it in white (like my B+D).Takes up more window real estate.  As much as I love the dual hose, it's big.  It takes a full 10"" of window vs. 6"" for my 8K BTU Black+Decker.Despite the drawbacks, I'm VERY happy with this unit and I strongly recommend it.

    Everything about this portable a.c. unit is outstanding.  Incredibly easy to unbox and set up.  I am a 68-yr-old woman, and I unboxed, assembled and got it running in about 30 minutes! Remote control works great; they even include the batteries.  I don't know about energy efficiency yet because I just got it.  Very simple to operate, solid, well-made.  Exceptional for the cost.  You do have to drain it, and it's a bit of a pain, which is the only conceivable downside.  The hose is longer when extended than expected.  It is not silent by any means, but it is not loud or noisy, either.  I normally have tv volume on 20; when unit is on, I boost tv audio to 27, so not bad.  The sound is pleasant, not grating or obtrusive.  It can easily be moved on casters from room to room and a simple matter to removed window adaptor and hose to install in another room, say a bedroom, at night.  This is the most glowing review I have ever given to an electronics item/small appliance.  I recommend it without hesitation.  If you don't have central air or a window unit and you have a limited budget, buy this.  You won't regret it!!!!

    I sleep hot regardless of the season. My options were to buy a huge fan and place it on me at all times during the night with a sheet as a blanket or just suffer through it. It took my bed being soaked with my sweat several summers in a row for me to give up and look into an air conditioner. I didn't want anything super amazing as the room I sleep in is fairly small. I did want a dual hose design since I've heard they're better at removing water from the system but it wasn't a deal breaker if I didn't get that.After much looking I came upon this unit. It has a remote, it works with Alexa, I can control the unit with my smartphone, it has the dual hose system but most importantly it's energy efficient. You see I used to have a hotel grade air conditioner and it ran most of the time due to the room it was in having no air flow. That unit was a champ as it kept that large room chilly all the time. Though it used a lot of power. It added over a hundred dollars to our power bill every month and I just couldn't deal with that again. Now this unit is much better but it only runs when I sleep and I clean the filter on the regular to keep it from using too much power. It hasn't broke my bank yet so that's always a plus. Oh, and did I mention this unit is a beast at cooling? I know I said the room is small but I'd never expect this unit to cool my bedroom in less than a couple of minutes like this unit does. Most of the time I forget to turn it on via my phone and it doesn't really matter. I enter my room, hit the on button and get into bed and within minutes I'm nice and chilly for a good nights sleep.I have very little to complain about with this air conditioner. It checks off a lot of boxes I had for what I wanted and then some. The only thing I can say is that it's a bit noisy. I don't see that as a bad thing cause most units are loud. Actually I don't know if I could sleep without the noise now. But if you have to have silence in order to drift off to dreamland then maybe find something else. The amount of features this unit has at a fairly decent price accompanied with it being energy efficient should be a top contender for most. Highly recommend.Whoops, almost forgot. My unit was missing the adapter that hooks to the plastic hose so to have water drawn away from the unit and into a better place. I contacted Midea for a replacement part and was told they don't carry certain parts and my only option was to send the entire unit back for a replacement. This was well after I had installed the unit. I, like the adult I am, called them stupid and argued their flawed logic. Sending a heavy piece of tech back because they forgot to add a small and almost weightless piece of plastic was asinine. Why put me and the poor delivery people through something so frustrating over something so simple. That conversation went on for too long and got me nowhere. In the end I didn't need the part but I highly suggest anyone buying this to check every part to make sure it's all there cause from what I can tell they don't carry parts that a normal company would.

    Ok, the unit arrived, boy howdy, it's big and heavy.But, installation is easy, the ""snorkel"" to route the warm air through a windows is solid/sturdy and adequate. The window slider to fit different size windows was solid and definitely wide enough for nearly every windows. So far so good.Why 4 stars (and I was generous)?Noise:It's noisy! forget ""whisper quite""... in A/C mode full blast you can NOT bear to sit next to it. Turn on, run(!) and leave room and come back when coldOr leave it at lowest level, which I do, then it's acceptable, it's in the office next to the desk Even then it starts to wear you down. I do think that you can NOT have this thing sitting in your bedroom and expect to sleep. Sorry.Water/Condensor:I was surprise, it stopped working after 2 h runtime with P1 error. Turns out, that means the condenser-reservoir is full and needs emptying.Well, it's at the very bottom of the unit, you need a very thin tray, saucer(?)to empty it. else you end up lifting the unit. Another 2 hours later: P1 again! Rinse repeat, I mean: empty, repeat.It's only 2 cups, 16 ounces, folks! I measured it. So this beast, this huge portable AC unit has a pint-sized condenser water reservoir. Why, guys, why?I ended up putting it up on an empty wine-box and letting it leak/dribble into a bigger bucket. See photo.

    Learning to use it took a while. With condenser input drawn from inside the house I am careful to use it only for precooling. I found that my wall furnace flue does'nt provide adequate air flow so I opened the stove vent baffle and provided good flow. That said, now we can feel the breeze, outside temperature is sucked right in. When it is 70 outside it is cool, when it is 108 it is hot! I plan to fabricate a duct system to give the condenser direct outside access so I can reseal our humble abode. I haven't worked in HVAC since 1960, but the basics don't appear to have changed.

    After less than a year of owning this product, I’m already going to have to purchase a new one. I’ve been attempting to use it to cool a 110sqf room, but unfortunately it barely works. For example, if outside temperature is 95, my room will still be 85 degrees even if the ac is set to 62. I have even had it serviced once, and regularly remove dust build up/ drain the reservoirs myself, and it doesn’t help. This product is most definitely not worth the money.

    January 2023 update: I kept the unit, packaging it back up seemed like a monumental task that I just didn’t want to tackle. This a/c, for all its flaws, kept my oven of a bedroom (poorly insulated, super high wood plank cabin style ceilings, all day full sun on three sides, top floor) cool in the summer. Bumping up to four stars for cooling power alone. Probably wildly inefficient, but it got the job done and then some. Going to work with a plastics place to make a custom window attachment for my horizontal slider to alleviate the tab and gap issues mentioned below.Original review:I was torn between this and the LG dual inverter, ended up purchasing this one because of the extra 2,000 doe. I wish I had gotten the LG instead. The unit body seems well made, but the inflexible giant stubby hose and the cheap and ineffective plastic window attachments completely ruin an otherwise decent a/c.1. I have a slider that moves sideways instead of up, so I needed the extra plastic attachment. You’re supposed to join the two halves together and insert a screw to hold them together.  The screw “screws” in, but it doesn’t keep the two pieces together because there seem to be no actual threads inside the hole.2. Because the hose isn’t round, you can’t just screw it into the window kit like a lid on a jar. Once you assemble this flimsy plastic horizontal converter, you attach it by snapping plastic tabs at each corner into the window kit. The V shaped tabs rely on pressure to stay snapped in, but the hose is too heavy and the plastic tabs keep coming unsnapped, leaving a gaping open hole on whatever side they popped off on. With all the popping off and popping back in, top tabs won’t make it long.3. The tabs popping off to leave an open hole is only the start of your outside air woes once you see the entire horizontal attachment has been DESIGNED with air gaps. Midea includes loads of foam to seal your windows, but honestly, why bother sealing anything when the actual window kit itself defeats the purpose?4. The hose is an interesting idea, but absolutely terrible in reality. Wildly inflexible, giant, and stubby, this unit can pretty much only be installed directly in front of the window. The manual says you should have 9 inches of clearance between the unit and the wall, which is impossible unless your window is exactly at hose height.In sum, if you have a horizontal sliding window (or maybe just a higher window), do yourself a favor and get the LG. I am not looking forward to the monumental task of packaging this back up to return.

    I bought this for my baby’s room since we don’t have central AC in our house. I have another brand of portable AC in our room, and you can physically feel the cold air coming out and the hose is hot to the touch. This one is set to the lowest setting of 62 and it’s not that cold blowing out, and the hose doesn’t feel like it’s pushing the hot air back outside. The temperature is currently 75 degrees in his room and it’s 80 outside, so I’m scared to test this on 95 degree days..

    I bought this last year but decided to write a review now. This unit actually works really great, however it's so inconvenient if you don't have anywhere for the water to dispose when it leaks out. I have a 13 gallon bucket where I put the hose to leak the water and it fills within a few hours. Then the screw at the bottom also has build up water that when you open it the water will go all over the floor. It works good but I wouldn't buy it again.

    Update:No one has ""reached out"" to try to solve this great dilemma of this high tech device functioning like a toaster. I'm left with my original problem. Is this $700 a/c better than the $250 window unit it replaced? The old window unit had controls allowing me to switch to ""low cool"" which made it quieter. Did that make it cheaper to operate? I don't know. What I do know is the fan speed was constant, allowing me to not be distracted by the *constant* changing of speeds this unit does. Even making it operate on a certain percentage of fan speed still has it making unnecessary sounds as it tries to decide how much or little to run its compressor. It seems an insolvable problem for it, as it changes CONSTANTLY! Did I get a bad unit? I don't know. I have nothing to compare it to. No one has reached out and I haven't seen any kind of tech support that reaches a ""real"" person (emails apparently don't).Has my power bill gone down? Absolutely not. I'm still trying to justify to my wife the purchase of this unit. We're still using the same amount of power we were before. Even the old window unit had a setting to shut itself off when it reached the proper temp. This thing just runs and runs.I'm lowering my rating another two stars. Even though this thing has the ability to cool that's something of legend, if it can't shut itself off, that's just bad programming. It's a fantastic design with afterthought programming, or maybe budget cuts. Or...I just got a bad one. Guess we'll never know. Since—apparently—NO ONE CARES.----I don't understand the nuances behind its functioning. Even when the temp in the room is 2 or 3° below the setting, it's still running. IT RUNS CONSTANTLY! I've done everything I can to try to control it. It's ALWAYS running. Left on Auto fan, it changes the air speed constantly, regardless of the set temp or the temp in the room. The only way to get it to stop is to turn it off. WTF?!?This isn't what I got this for. It's constantly changing the compressor and fan speeds--constantly! It doesn't seem to know how to just leave good enough alone and shut DOWN!!! I have the app, the only way to have any level of control over it, but that does very little.The remote is completely useless. If you change the temp with the app, the remote is clueless and vice versa. If the a/c, the remote, and the app can't communicate with each other, what's the f'ing point?!?It's a solid product. It cools its a$$ off! It's a shame the software behind it is SO lacking. It's basically an on/off device because of incompetent programming. So much squandered potential....

    My FAVORITE Portable AC!
  
",5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,Blaze2k,评论于 2022年8月5日 在美国 🇺🇸 发布,"So starting off, this Summer has been BRUTAL with EVERY single day in July/August over 100f and May/June being high 90 and low 100’s. The AC systems in our homes were struggling and racking up the bill with us spending often $9-11 a day to cool with both helping each other. We also have poor insulation which is something we’ve had to try and tackle ourselves.

In the end we got fed up of running the homes existing AC system because it was simply too expensive and opted to get a Window/Portable AC. The windows on our home are very flimsy and not at all suited for window units sadly and frankly we weren’t too keen on having to drill into things, worry about them falling out and having the hassle of having to bring them in every other season. So we opted to go for a portable.

Now there’s two different kinds of portable AC units. Single Hose and Dual Hose. Single hose units suck in air from the room which creates negative pressure in the room and pulling in hot air from either gaps/cracks in the doors/windows and blows all the hot air out the single hose. The single vent hose gets very hot - so between the negative pressure pulling in heat and the hot hose these single hose units have to try and fight those two things to keep the room cool which can REALLY lower their efficiency. Hence why you’ll see units advertise 14,000 BTU’s then in brackets have a lower BTU usually half of the first BTU rating. The second BTU number is the SAAC rating which basically takes into account the heat pulled into the room from the negative pressure and the hose and tells you how efficient it is. So units that advertise 14,000BTU typically use the power of a 14,000 BTU unit but are only really equivalent to a 7000 BTU unit with those other things taken into account.

Dual-hose units (like this one) pull air in from the outside eliminating much of the negative pressure issue (where heat is sucked in from cracks/windows/doors) hence why the secondary SAAC BTU rating is much higher. And in my experience the vent hose is actually much cooler.

This dual-hose design on the Midea/Toshiba is quite unique. They have decided to combine both hoses into one big wide unwieldy thing which sucks if you want to angle your portable AC to face it in a certain direction, but the benefit of it is that it goes vertically up from the back of the machine and bends up then down meaning you can shove it closer to and up-against the wall/window which you cant do on other units. Kudos to them. So it has its pros/cons. Pro: Being able to shove it against the wall / Con: not being able to angle it.

Now we first decided to buy the Toshiba version of this AC from Home Depot for our living room. It’s the exact same machine as this but in white. Midea and Toshiba are the same company. We set it up as soon as we received it and had it set up in minutes! I recommend cutting the foam seal tape down the middle so you have two strips and instead of sticking it on the window-sill, stick it around the window vent plate for the AC. That way you can remove the plate and shut the window in a jiffy if you decide to move the unit!

We set it up with the app straight away and I love all the features and control I have over the unit from the app. It’s awesome. Just to be clear the Toshiba app is what I use to control both my Midea and Toshiba unit (yes I bought a Midea after the Toshiba since I loved the unit so much!) The app allows you to remotely turn on the unit, set the temperature, the swing function, turn on/off the LED display, make schedules and more! I can’t go back to a different brand after having this (yes I tried to cheap out with my second portable - I’ll explain soon).

Anyhow we have a large openspace ground floor which merges into the upstairs hallway w/ high ceilings and despite this portable AC being rated for 550sqft it does an pretty good job of cooling the downstairs living area. Our master bedroom is downstairs and granted, that doesn’t get much cooling since its well out of the way but that’s fine. Since getting this portable AC we’ve been able to turn off our MAIN downstairs AC system from MORNING (when we get up and out the bedroom) till BED TIME when we go to bed. And this little guy keeps the downstairs living area VERY comfortable the entire day on its own during these 100-110f days in Texas. This has saved us a fortune in electricity.

Also this portable AC, not only does it have remote smartphone control, google home/alexa smarthome functionality BUT it also uses something called a smart variable inverter technology. So unlike other bog standard portable ACs which loudly turn on and run at full power/volume then shut off abrubptly when they meet the desired temp - then ramp up again when the temp creeps up. The Midea and Toshiba are able to gently ramp up and down the power depending on the situation. Other portable AC’s turn on and draw a full 1300W whereas the Midea/Toshiba can run and drop to as low as 50w when the fan is running, maintain temps at a low 300-500w or work a little harder and stay at 900w or if its really working hard ramp up to 1300w. This works brilliantly to save on the noise and power usage. It’s not running at all or nothing all the time. It’s smart, it can adjust the power and power draw to suit the conditions. This like I said helps conserve energy and keeps noise at a minimum. THAT BEING SAID, it would be nice if Midea/Toshiba added the ability in the app to allow us to force it to run at full power if we so wished rather than let it decide when to conserve power etc.

Overall, for our downstairs, this unit (at least the Toshiba we got) was WELL WORTH the investment.

NOW - Onto PART 2. Cooling the upstairs (specifically my home office) which I work in every day.

Despite the Toshiba version of this Midea doing an amazing job of cooling the downstairs. The upstairs and my office was like a damn oven. I came to the conclusion that if i wanted to get ANY work done in my office upstairs I had the choice of running the main upstairs AC which effectively couldn’t keep up and would run FULL blast the entire day costing us a fortune OR invest in another portable AC.

I decided to purchase another portable AC and instead of buying another Toshiba/Midea dual-hose unit I decided to cheap out and try the Black and Decker 14,000BTU(7000BTU SAAC) since it was well reviewed on Amazon despite it being a single hose unit with no smart features. Well…. BIG MISTAKE. As I said earlier in the review, the single hose was like a damn oven defeating the purpose of cooling the room if it has a hot burning heater of a hose behind it. I can’t talk about the negative pressure/leaking in hot air since I can’t measure that. But despite it being in a 100sqft office room and the unit was rated for 450sqft, it would run CONSTANTLY and STRUGGLE to keep the room at a comfortable temp. I asked myself “What’s the point of this thing” it cost me $500 after taxes and it was doing nothing. It also rumbled on and off and consumed max power at all times at some times going as high as 1800W almost tripping my breaker! Worst of all was I missed the app and smart controls I enjoyed on my downstairs Toshiba/Midea.
So… after a few days I bit the bullet and said screw this, filed a return on the Black and Decker and pulled the trigger on the Midea 14,000 (12,000btu saac) which essentially was just a couple of hundred dollars more with better efficiency and many more smart features/remote control.

I REALLY missed being able to turn the AC on in advance downstairs via the app and set schedules.

Well the Midea arrived, I liked the black as opposed to the white of the Toshiba but it’s essentially identical. The Midea app wasn’t compatible with my Z Fold 3 for some reason so I had a go at setting it up with the Toshiba app and to my surprise - the Midea AC works just fine with the Toshiba app as the Toshiba AC does! They are all essentially the same app with minor differences.

Well, weeks later I am THOROUGHLY impressed with the Midea as much as I am with my Toshiba downstairs. They are both on the same app so I can control both seperately using the one app which is nice.

I’ve not had any issue with the fan inside ripping itself apart or shaking the machine. It’s running perfectly. Just make sure its sitting on a good flat level surface :)

The Midea can cool my office down to the low 60’s if needed making it like a darn fridge. It’s awesome, I’ve had fun pushing it to its limits. It feels like magic on a 105f day, walking into my home office and it’s actually chilly cold lol.

I now have no need to use EITHER the main downstairs or upstairs AC systems LOL.

Anyhow, to round off my review I just want to share how ecstatic I am about this unit and have NO QUALMS about recommending it to others. Now as for the issues I have read, they could potentially be from dodgy delivery issues (from being bumped/knocked around or dropped during transport.) So I guess it really comes down to whether you get lucky and your unit moves through the delivery/courier system delicately or not. I saw some pictures where peoples boxes were all bashed in, dented and the rotating fan part was bashed into the unit. I suppose that could be why many of the people with issues have had such a bad experience - their unit was damaged in transport. But it seems I was lucky enough to receive my two units in good shape.

Now the Toshiba variant of this (in white) is actually selling for $649 on Home Depots website right now but they go in and out of stock on a regular basis and can be hard to buy (I guess they are popular) but if you can, why not save 50bucks. Plus I’d probably trust Home Depots delivery people more than Amazons for big fragile items like this. But if you get the Midea (providing the delivery/transport goes well) you’ll be just as happy.

My wife is now tempted to get one for her office upstairs and hell I wouldn’t mind getting one for our master bedroom downstairs too if budget permits one day. But I am VERY happy with my two units I have right now and I hope Toshiba/Midea keep supporting this unit because it is an absolute gem!

Pros:
- VERY ENERGY EFFICIENT
- Great for space (can tuck it closer to the wall/window) because of the hose design
- Much better SAAC BTU rating
- Decent noise
- LOTS of Smart Home functionality (APP and Google Home/Alexa support)

Cons:
- Can’t angle it left/right very much because of the dual-hose in one design
- Not as quiet as they advertise (but what can you expect when the condenser is inside the room with you)

JUST BUY IT ALREADY (and good luck with the delivery/shipping) :D","颜色: 黑色//白色尺寸: 14,000 BTU with Heat","颜色: 黑色//白色尺寸: 14,000 BTU with Heat",https://www.amazon.com/MAP08R1CWT-Portable-Conditioner-Dehumidifier-control/product-reviews/B087CQVC9G/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_paging_btm_next_17?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&pageNumber=17

    The drain design alone makes this a 1 star product
  
",1.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,Ryland Wallace,评论于 2022年8月1日 在美国 🇺🇸 发布,"







  
  
    The drain design alone makes this a 1 star product. Every portable air conditioner I have owned auto drains through the exhaust, but not this unit, it has a *manual* drain. Every 45 minutes the unit will stop cooling and display a P1 code meaning the drain needs to be emptied. The drain port is so low to the ground on the back of the unit you can barely get a dinner plate under it to catch the water coming out, and that is only with lifting the AC unit slightly for my plates, which keep in mind it is almost 80lbs. It is a very awkward exercise crawling on the floor, inevitably makes a mess, and when pulling the AC away from the wall to access the drain port the hose disconnects from the window and adds to the frustration. It comes with a drain hose to attach to the drain port to run to a drain source, and I tried using that hose to a bucket but it will not push the water up any elevation at all, so unless the bucket is somehow underneath the AC unit, it again just shuts off saying the drain needs to be emptied. I spent more time with towels to dry water off the hardwood floors from drain mishaps then I'd care to admit. Over an 8 hour period I'd need to do this 10+ times which is ridiculous. Aside from shutting off every 45 min, and requiring a painful manual drain procedure, the unit performs fantastic. Powerful, quiet, the auto rotating vents distribute air well. But the drain! Possibly not an issue in extremely dry climates. I'm returning this unit, it just isn't worth the hassle. The Whynter ARC-1230WNH is virtually the same unit featuring dual hose and inverter tech with the same BTU level, but it also properly auto drains through the exhaust and costs only $30 more, which is easily worth it.

    Perfect a/c for small room. Very well packaged and easy to install. Exhaust hose and everything snaps together, and slide for window venting works even w/ my screen in place which was a huge bonus for me to prevent insects coming inside. The noise level is quieter than our box or pedestal fans. My only complaint is some of the directions for settings on unit and remote are not clear. So we had a bit of trial and error.  But it works very well and is powerful.

    Excellent Portable Air Conditioner
  
",5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,That Guy,评论于 2022年7月31日 在美国 🇺🇸 发布,"







  
  
    I have this same A/C in white.  It’s a terrific air conditioner.  When on the low setting, it really is very quiet.  However, when cranked up, it can get pretty loud, but it’s not as loud as the window units unless they have the inverter compressor as well.It really is an energy efficient A/C.  I’ve got mine hooked up to a watt meter with my electric rate and I’ve been running it straight for over a month (not on high) and I’ve only burned just under $55.00 in electricity.These A/C’s are good in that you don’t have a “box” sitting in your window.  Installation is very easy. Tip: put the adhesive insulation around the edging of the window plenum instead of on the window frame as noted in the instructions.  This way, you can remove it and switch to another window if you desire.  Of course, you’ll have to remove the pins that hold the length of the plenum in place if the window frames are different sizes, but it can be done.The trade off of the inverter as opposed to a normal compressor is that they don’t cool quite as well.  That’s not to say that these will not cool your room.  In a normal A/C, the compressor runs at a consistent speed the entire time and the air temp coming out is at it’s coldest whether on high or low.  So, you can set the window (non inverter) unit on low and the air comes out really cold.  However, your burning more electricity this way.The inverter compressor seems to be more tied to fan speed AND temperature.  In other words, when the fan is on the lowest, the compressor is not ramped up to it’s highest to have really cold air.  It’s cold, but not like on a normal compressor unit.  So, as you turn the temperature down, the fan will spool up accordingly. (Until the room cools down and then it will slow down.)  It’s strange, because the unit comes with 3 fan speeds, with the last being “auto”, but they all appear to have an “auto” mode from my experience.  This is what allows this particular unit though to be much more energy efficient.  If you like it really cold, then you’ll have to run this unit at the lowest temp with the highest fan setting.  It will be much louder, but still somewhat reasonable.  You may be better off with a traditional window unit (non inverter).  Again, it will slow down when the room finally gets to your desired temp setting.Many people complain about the condensate.  I live in the Houston area and have not had to drain it since I received it.  I have checked the drains in the rear and I did have about 3 or 4 ounces of water come out.  In order to test it completely, I hooked the included drain hose up to a 1 quart jar and let it run over night.  In the morning the jar was completely full.  The way the unit works (once the humidity level in the room has dropped due to usage) is that the unit uses the condensate to help cool the condenser.  It uses the condensate and evaporates it and exhausts it through the hose to help cool the unit.  It does work well since I have not had to drain the unit one time.Some people complain that they are always draining the unit due to the “error code” for a full condensate pan.  They must be in a room that is staying abnormally humid in order for this to occur.  Once the unit has dried the air out, it should not be a problems.  Remember, I’m in the Houston area and have not problems.In addition, a lot of people complain of the inconvenient drain plug at the very bottom of the unit.  I agree, that one is very inconvenient, being so close to the floor.  However, it’s the very top plug that the condensate initially drains from.  The bottom drain appears to be an overflow plug/reservoir to the top plug.  So if you’re in a humid environment, initially, check and drain from the top plug to begin with periodically, which is much easier to drain from.  Once the room has dropped to a reasonable humidity level, you should not have to drain it at all.  Again, I have not had to drain my unit one time.This Midea unit seems to be very popular, and rightfully so.  I was actually looking to buy a second one and could not find any.  I decided to try the Danby Inverter 3 in 1 unit.  Other than a cosmetically different air vent and remote control, in addition to only being the “3 in 1” unit, they are identical.  In fact, the Danby is manufactured by Midea.  The Danby unit works with the Midia phone app and the remote controls for each unit work on each unit as well.  The big difference between the two is that the Midea has the heat pump heater mode, where the Danby does not.  The Danby is generally cheaper too.So, if you are looking for the Midea and can do without the heater function, get the Danby since they are identical.Hopefully this helps someone with their decision making.

Its powerful enough thay it's cooling the dining room and the kitchen as well with some well placed fans.  It's quieter than most windows units I've used before.(To those wondering why it's on a chair, it's because I have cats who would absolutely try to dig out, so I needed the exhaust up top.)Update: Turns out our centrak AC was actually broken and needed to be replaced. This little unit has been cooling our entire house! (About 1000 sq/ft) The rooms are warm (up to 80 during the day) down the hallway, but it gets down to 73 at night with the help of this machine.

    I bought this unit in February because I wanted to be prepared for the summer heat. I started using it in late May and it kept the house cool as I have another unit in the back room in between the two of them the house was nice. It's on its own dedicated circuit that's 20 amps so it shouldn't have a problem. The weather started getting about 95 to 100 this week and the machine would just pop the house circuit breaker it would not pop the breaker in the cord. The cord breaker is working because we can push test and it stops it but for some reason as soon as it gets hot outside it pops the house breaker. I tried plugging it into another outlet that wasn't on that circuit and it did the same thing. Once the weather cools down in the evening you can turn it on it'll run all night long if you want it to. Frustrating it's a lot of money can't return it because the return window is closed and it's not doing as good as the little unit I've had for 10 years.

    We replaced a portable LG brand with this Midea. Packing was great, no broken/missing parts. Install was very easy. In 97 degree weather, this unit cooled a 2nd floor bedroom in an old home easily. Very, very quiet compared to LG and with inverter technology, you don't hear the compressor going on and off at night. Dual hose design keeps the heat from bleeding back into the room. Money well spent.

    I was looking forward to this unit, as I own a Midea U unit which has been amazing, quiet and cools very quickly and efficient. This portable unit is noisy. Mine has a sqeak in it that is just annoying and constant. My smaller u unit dehumidifies 10x faster. This unit seems to struggle. This unit is 12k and my U is only 10k with both running I can definitely tell it's not up to par. Wish I would have bought it at a store so I would have been able to just simply return it! Buyer beware. The remote is also a hassle and the temperature gauge is not correct. Tested against other temp gauges.

    Ok so I just had this thing leak all over the place. The drain hose was still connected and in a bucket so I don't know where it leaked from. Then I realize there is no air filter in the back. This thing also throws off a lot of heat from the back. This is my only experience with a portable AC so maybe they are all like this but I am going back to a window unit. This has turned into a mess.

     I noticed it wasn't working properly after the first month so I read the manual. it says I have to drain the water and I did but, after I did that I got the message again so now I have the tube draining the water while it's on and it seem.s to be working fine. This thing is definitely not energy efficient because my bill went up 100 bucks.

    Rattling noise FIXED!
  
",3.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,kswen,评论于 2022年7月26日 在美国 🇺🇸 发布,"







  
  
    Ok, we were able to fix the rattling noise after about 1.5 hours of taking this beast apart. It's tricky but doable. I didn’t video it, but I will do my best to explain what we did.- Contact Amazon and get a refund. You’ll have to take a video of the rattling noise and send it to them. Once you’ve got your refund, you won’t be afraid to accidentally break this unit.- Take off the screen to the metal coils, and the hose.- Unscrew all the screws in the back of the unit. Don’t worry about the front. Note that the screws that are further in have a point in the end. The other screws have a flat end.- Turn the unit on its side and look at the bottom. On both sides, the case should bow out when you pull on it. There is an internal screw just inside the case. We took some pliers and dug it out, which was pretty easy. These screws don't seem to be integral to holding the unit together, so don’t worry about putting them back.- Turn the unit right side up. At the top of the unit, Take a flat head screwdriver and wedge it between the seam of the front and back casing. You’ll hear a snapping sound and that’s ok. The snaps holding the front and back are coming apart but not breaking. Continue to unsnap all the way down then repeat on both sides, using the screwdriver to help if needed (we needed it). The unit back should come off.Now the tricky part….- There is a plastic piece covering the fan and dividing the fan from the other part with metal coils. You’ll have to take this off. Unscrew the screws securing it, I think there are two.- Once the screws are removed, try and wiggle the plastic covering off. It’s tricky because there is a flimsy plastic piece holding it where the metal coils are while another part slides into place. Keep wiggling and fiddling with it. Once you get it, the sweet rush of this small victory will wash over you. You aren’t done yet, but take a moment to rejoice.- Once that plastic cover is off, you should see where the rattling noise is coming from. For us, the plastic piece above the fan is misaligned and part of it hangs down.- There are two screws that secure the casing around the fan. Removing them won’t take the casing off, but it will allow enough give that if you gently pull it apart, you can snap the misaligned plastic piece in place. One screw is located on the front of the fan casing, about 3 inches down. The other one is on the side.- Once those are off, you'll need two people for this part. One person needs to gently pull the plastic casing away and one person will maneuver the part hanging down above the fan into place.- The rattling noise should be fixed now. We were able to run it at that point to make sure.- Celebrate your full victory.I see a lot of other complaints about this unit. We’ve gotten it to work for the past hour, but who knows if it’ll encounter other issues. So far, it’s cooling our upstairs quickly and that’s all we can ask for right now.

    Don't buy one with only 1 hose, it pulls air from outside which defeats it's purpose.

    This is nearly useless. It most a lot of air, and that air is indeed cooled. But the problem is that it's blowing air from inside, to outside. That means it needs to pull air somewhere else from outside to inside. So while it does work at cooling air, it doesn't actually cool the room off. This is in a small camper too, so only 168 sq feet. It should be overkill for this small space. The hose is horrible too, it's blowing hot air through it, and disipating that heat back into the room so you have to wrap it in insulation to keep that heat from escaping the blower vent host. If this had another hose for air intake it would definitely function better, then it would be able to cycle air from outside into the cooling unit, then blow the heated air back outside and cycle air from inside over the cooled coils for the cooling. It really has to be literally 3 feet away from me and pointed directly at me to have any beneficial cooling, the rest of the camper doesn't get any effect beccause of the air leaching from any crack/crevice that air can be pulled inside through. A window mounted unit was what I wanted but thought/hoped this would work better. Not in the least. Don't buy this unit, or any other that only has a vent for blowing the hot air outside.

    I had purchased 2 of the Midea U shaped 8000 BTU air conditioners. They are superb; quiet, efficient. Great engineering and even great packaging and manual. I figured that their portable AC had to be great also.WRONG. I ordered one, unpacked it after letting it rest vertically. It was quite noisy, but that was not important compared to the experience that followed. The manual said I should not operate it without the filter. Whoops. I turned it off and opened the door to where the filter should be. (This was clear in the manual.) Nothing. I called the company. They were pleasant but clueless when I asked about the filter. We could never really communicate since (are you sitting down?) they had an out of date manual that gave irrelevant instructions for the filter. They had no access to the manual that I was using, and no way to advise me. I replaced it with another of the same units. The experience was another of the same.  I told myself ""just buy two of the U shaped inverter AC units.""  I did. It was the right decision.

    Great Cooling but Loud

    I purchased this air conditioner to cool down our bedroom at night so I don't need run central air and cool the whole house just to keep the bedroom temperature comfortable. The unit easily cuts trough the Wisconsin summer heat and humidity and cools not just the bedroom (approx. 150 sq. ft.) but also the hallway and parts of an adjacent office. Installation was not a big issue. All parts snap in easily, and I did not find the manual confusing at all. So, that is all good.What is not good is that at least in my case Midea overpromised on the noise level. This unit was not ""extremely quiet"" and is much louder than our refrigerator. I measured the noise and it was way beyond what is promised. I'd compare the noise level to a dryer (laundry) and found it impossible to sleep when the unit is on even on lower settings. Remember that they claim it is extremely quiet on the highest setting. I called Midea's customer service, which was responsive and easy to reach. Interestingly, they asked me about unusual noises (rattling, high-pitch, etc.) while I maintained that nothing seems to rattle or squeak , it is just very loud. Then, over the phone, the rep listened to the unit and said it does not sound right and I should send it back. They did not mention that I should get a replacement and that my unit might be unusually loud (that cannot be judged over the phone anyway). I sent it back and did not order a new unit because I am not confident that it would be quieter. Had they not made that comparison to the fridge, I wouldn't have bought it in the first place because I understand how loud the individual parts (condenser, fan, etc.) are. The reason why they have a highly-rated window unit is because they move these loud parts outside.Overall, great cooling, good customer service, questionable advertising for a loud AC.

    The unit does cool a small room, but after awhile if the surrounding area isn't cool as well it draws in warm air from the rest of the house.  The exhaust tube needs to be insulated because it gets very hot and can defeat the purpose of the AC by heating the area around it.  The remote and related thermostat programming is way off.  I usually have to press the buttons twice (with new batteries) even if I'm right next to the unit. It rarely picks up a change to the thermostat setting and seems to turn on and off without reason. If it starts to get obviously warm, beyond the thermostat setting, the only way to get it to turn on is by turning the unit on and off.  So it requires resets often to work correctly.  Needs work, wouldn't recommend as there are better units out there.
