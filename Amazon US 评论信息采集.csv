    Super Quiet
  
",4.0 ,Allen Risler,"Reviewed in the United States April 13, 2023","







  
  
    I found this unit in search of the quietest AC Unit.  This superior design is like a mini-split.  The window closes down to only open about 4"" which blocks the noisy part of the unit outside.  The first one arrived damaged but was quickly replaced.  Several reviews on YouTube show people using this 12,000 BTU cooling their entire first floor, around 1000 sq ft., even though it is rated for 550 sq ft, so I mounted this one in the living room.  This should significantly reduce the need to run the central AC and save a lot on the electric bill this summer.

    Manufacturing Issue
  
",1.0 ,MK53,"Reviewed in the United States April 12, 2023","







  
  
    After installing the mounting, we were ready to install the actual unit. We placed it on the mounting and then found that due to a manufacturing issue we couldn’t install a screw. The hole for the screw would not align due to a slight bowing issue. You can see in the second image how the seam/line is bigger near the bottom where it slightly bows out. That then doesn’t allow for an alignment of the hole in the third picture. Extremely frustrating to be moving something this big around just to find it doesn’t work and having to take the mounting down.

    EC 07 Fix! Had issues out of the box but got to work!
  
",3.0 ,Robert Lussier,"Reviewed in the United States April 12, 2023","







  
  
    Had issues directly out of the box, error code EC 07. Went through trouble shooting with the company and didn’t really help so decided to trouble shoot myself, noticed the condenser fan was kicking on and looked stuck and blocked. So i opened the back top side and found that the fan was getting stuck on some hard malleable black sticky stuff that was around hard pipes that lead to the condenser. I was able to form what i think is some type of insulation out of the way from the fan which allowed the fan to have enough room to spin. Put the AC back together and now works fine.This saved a trip to return to ups and the headache of getting a replacement.AC now blows cold and is super quiet, other than the above issues I’m satisfied with the product.

    Review update...I changed my review from a 1 star to a 4 star. After taking the ac apart I noticed some black gooey stuff that was causing the fan not to turn. I moved the goo over and now it works great.Looks nice and blows out really cold air for about 5 minutes then kicked off and showed EC 07 code. The fan isn't working.

    Easy to install. Would’ve been easier if I had a second person to help with it. The part that opens and closes the vent was broken. Had to use tape to keep the vent open. May try some superglue to try and fix the broken part. Could’ve used a bit more insulating foam. Had to order some more. Don’t like the remote control at all. Using the app or the smart speaker to control it works well.

    I got this to prevent my overzealous kitten from breaking out of the traditional accordion style window units. This thing is great and is very secure once everything is set up. The breeze it generates is amazing, and it cools my entire large apartment.I got the 12000 BTU and lifted it myself up 3 floors. So far I really like it and am happy I purchased this. I suggest watching install videos vs reading instructions only. It helped me.

    Quiet but there are too many air gaps
  
",2.0 ,Preferred Customer,"Reviewed in the United States April 11, 2023","







  
  
    Overall it's a good AC unit. It is quiet, so that's the best part. What I don't like is that there are too many gaps even after using all of the foam strips and panels that come with it. The bottom gaps are very obvious. I tried to seal them with duck tape, but apparently that's not enough because where I live, it's always windy, and the wind blows a great amount of dirt into the room from underneath the unit. Although I also used duck tape to seal the top and sides, in addition to the foam that came with it, dirt also comes in from the top and sides. That room, which is being used as a home office, is always so so dirty, as compared to the other bedrooms. I tried to see if I could buy new side panels to try to reinstall the unit in an effort to better seal the gaps, but the manufacturer only sells the thin black foam strips, which can be found anywhere (ex. Lowe's.) They DO NOT sell the side hard foam white panels that have the appearance of foam poster boards but thicker. I even chatted with one of their customer representatives, and they confirmed that they don't sell those. That's ridiculous!

    Pleasure to use, A demon to install, Warranty statement full of loop holes - Buyer Beware
  
",4.0 ,C4DB,"Reviewed in the United States April 9, 2023","







  
  
    Read the installation manual and decide if you can install it.  It took me half a day and I've installed a great many window AC's in the last 50 years.  (My Big Bend Texas ranch house has 5 right now.)  It's just a very complex installation that will vary greatly on your specific window and sill design and construction.  It's not the typical unbox, place in window, pull the sides in place and turn it on AC.  As to claims of quiet and energy efficiency:  All Claims are Absolutely True - nothing like it - get the specs from others - 15 on the Energy Star scale (max wattage is only 750) only 42 decibels loud (near silent), and very cold.  Mine arrived in an unblemished box, but upon opening showed signs of poor assembly and negligent packing.  Strongly suggest you buy a third party warranty since Midea's warranty statement has so many expensive loop holes that I believe it to be in violation of the Uniform Commercial Code.  In short - buy it from a company that will install it and service it if you can (not an option in the wilderness where I live).

    VERY quiet and I saved $$$ on my electric bill
  
",5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,James A. Jancik,2023年4月9日 在美国审核,"







  
  
    I bought my first via Media's GoFundMe page as I was attracted by the claimed very low noise and the use of DC and its lower electrical usage. They both turned out to be VERY true. I bought a second one and with the combined use, the electric bill dropped about 20% in the summer (over our other window units) and you virtually cannot hear it! I just bought my third to replace the unit in my sound studio because of the lack of noise and the Wi-Fi remote app so I can turn it on to cool off the studio before broadcasting/recording. The U-design was really irrelevant to me as I do not plan to open the windows while it is installed. But, it might significantly contribute to the now noise.The cost to buy the two is WAY lower than central air, and the cost to run them would be much lower than the projected electricity cost of the central AC as well.

    Great Feature Set and Very Quiet
  
",5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,JHH,2023年4月8日 在美国审核,"







  
  
    This is a very good window air conditioning unit, with a very well thought out installation process. It manages to look a bit less obtrusive than typical units of this type. It cools exceedingly well, and is very quiet in operation. The remote control is fully featured and works well. My only gripe is this (and I don't know if it's Midea's fault or Amazon's): the 360° view of the unit shows the exhaust fins as covered by a metal sheet and therefore not visible. In fact, the fins are just as visible on this product as they are on every other window air conditioner on the market. I am annoyed because this was a selling point for me, as it sits near the front of my home, and anything that can reduce ""that window air conditioner look"" would be a big plus. This unit performs so well, however, that I elected to keep it. I did paint the exterior housing and support bracket to match the house, so it blends in much better than out of the box, but I am nonetheless disappointed with the false representation of the product's appearance.

",5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,ruby,2023年4月7日 在美国审核,"







  
  
    I love the air conditioner, although I have a very wide window so I had to improvise to properly seal the unit as the support bracket does not stretch far enough to be screwed in to the side of window frame. The provided sealing blocks don’t compensate for wide windows. So what I did is cut the styrofoam packaging to the same dimensions as the foam blocks which worked perfectly, just make sure you make it a tight fit if you attempt this. I bought this because my central AC struggles in the summer so this will definitely help as well as it being quiet so it won’t disturb my baby as she sleeps.

    Do not buy this unit!  After only 1.5 years of operation the coils all along the bottom of the unit are corroded!!!  Most humans would never take them time to take it apart and clean it!  I felt compelled to do so because of a funky odor coming out of it.  After doing some research I decided to head to hardware store to purchase some coil cleaner and clean it myself as I am a professional handyman and felt i could take on the job. My recommendation to you is to stay away from this product as they refused to replace it do to the 1 year warranty policy!  This unit is defective and there is no way it should be on the market at all due to corrosion/materials issues!

    5 star unit but system for foam sealing is slightly awkward
  
",5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,BB,2023年4月2日 在美国审核,"







  
  
    I am truly awed by the design and function of this air conditioner, a machine that I've always taken for granted and largely ignored. As someone who has owned probably 10 window units in my life, this one's design is really a breath of fresh air (pun intended!). It's not just the fact that the window can go through the unit, which let's in a surprising amount of natural light that would otherwise be lost, it's also how well designed the safety precautions and unit-window fit are. The operation is quiet as heck, and the unit cools the place down fast. Moreover, in my opinion anyway, the price difference between this unit and a traditional one is really acceptable (~$150).Installation was easy, basically you just screw the support bracket into your window sill and let gravity do the rest. Where I would knock off .01 star—there are 4 different foam materials that come with the unit to fill in the negative space. In one case, you are surrounding a large foam block with foam ribbon. In another, you are taping adhesive foam to cover holes in the bracket. In both cases, there is not enough foam ribbon or adhesive foam, and my window is only 32"" wide. Easy enough, just bought more at hardware store, but I was surprised that even after applying the four different foam materials as instructed, there was still a lot of space left to fill, especially considering how well everything else was designed (including the app). Def an amazing purchase.

    Awful Support / Awful product
  
",1.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,Wes,2023年3月29日 在美国审核,"







  
  
    The product kept tripping my circuit breaker after about 5 to 10 seconds of plugging it in. I have another portable unit that I use on the same outlet that uses considerably more power and has no issue. I called support to try to figure out if I should order a new one, and when I was asking about the product, they refused to help me and acted stupid until I gave them a model number.  I told them him it was the 8000 BTU window slotted unit that you could open and close your window with.  I told him I didn’t care about the unit I had because I’m sending it back and I’m going to order another one. I want to make sure I won’t have the same issue, but they kept concentrating on the unit that I had packed up in my garage and wanted me to go out there to get the actual model off the box. I have done support before and I knew my products well enough to provide support based on basic product information.  It is literally the first product that comes up. When you look at the window air conditioners.  They paid Slater from saved by the bell to do an advertisement for them for this air conditioner, and they acted like they had no idea what air conditioner I was talking about.  I actually asked for a supervisor and she got all pompous and said, why did you need a supervisor?!?!Also, the installation was awful. The foam pieces didn’t fit very well and weren’t very flexible, if that is the right word.  I had to cut slots into the foam to get it to go into the grooves of where the window slides.  There were still gaps, also gaps under the air conditioner where bugs can get in.All this effort installing it is, it didn’t even work. Do yourself a favor and plug it in first to see if trips your circuitry.  first picture is their unit power usage, and the second picture is the portable one I use with no issue in the same exact outlet.  The portable one uses far more power without any issues. I plugged into a UPS and left the UPS plugged in and same issue.  No erratic power I will spikes when the unit tripped the circuit though  Nothing for several minutes of letting it run on the ups to show any irregularities to cause it to keep tripping the circuit.  This is also with turning everything else in the room off.  The higher power portable air conditioner runs fine with everything else on in the room. The portable air conditioner is a 6.6 seer rating and the window unit is a 15 seer rating.  It makes no logical sense why this much of lower wattage unit is causing such an issue.  I guess I will never know because their support refused to help me because I wouldn’t go out to my garage to get the model number. All I wanted was confirmation that the unit was defective and this wasn’t normal.

    I bought this after reading the reviews.  They did not disappoint.  This unit is very efficient and has plenty of power while being extremely quiet.  It is more or less a mini split just made very compact.

    My partner and I purchased this AC because the one we had was so loud we couldn’t be in the room with it on. This new AC is very beautiful, high tech, and SUPER quiet. My only complaint with it is that it’s not super powerful. We got 800 BTU for a bedroom which is reasonable and it took a few hours to cool off. Since it’s energy efficient and so quiet, we just leave it on all the time so we don’t have to worry about how long it takes to cool off. Also using the app on your phone is pretty easy to control the AC from anywhere. It even tells you current temp inside and outside. I can’t speak for install because someone did that for me.

    I love this AC unit. A bit of a fiddle to install, but once installed it's perfect. Doesn't block the view out of the window, the window can be raised on those days when ac isn't needed, it's so quiet -quieter than my fridge! It's very efficient. I used one in my downstairs, which is roughly 1000 sq ft, and it did a great job of keeping it cool. I'll be getting a couple more!

    Not recommended for humid climate - lack of drainage hole causes stagnant and odorous water buildup
  
",2.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,Amazon Customer,2023年3月27日 在美国审核,"







  
  
    Bought this unit 3 months ago based on good general reviews and innovative designs. Installation was pretty easy and I followed directions to make sure it slanted backwards. Unit ran well and was good at meeting my cooling needs; everything seemed great at first.About 2 months in, started noticing a foul smell whenever the fans first start running from idle. Cleaned out the filter but the issue persisted. Started googling about this and discovered that many people had complaints with mold growth in this unit due to difficulty in taking the unit apart for cleaning, and also lack of drainage hole in the outside portion.I finally took the unit down and opened it up outside after the smell became unbearable and started to negatively affect my health. I discovered that about a third of the bottom of the outside unit is constantly submerged in about an inch and half of gross brownish gunky water filled dead bugs and god knows what. This water just sits there stagnant in the back of the ac, not high enough to spill out of the overflow, and a sniff confirmed that this was indeed the source of the same smell that I was getting indoors.After researching extensively into this topic, I found that Midea purposely doesn't have drainage holes in this unit so the fan can scope up the residual water buildup and splash it around as a cooling mechanism to save energy. There are however problems I found with this explanation; First of all, the circular scoop that the fan uses to pick up the water doesn't sit flush against the bottom of the case; Its actually about an inch up. This means that there needs to be at least an inch of water inside the case for it to even start using this feature. Unless this water is freshly condensed and then evaporates out routinely, you are going to have a stagnant water buildup inside this case, especially if you live anywhere humid like I do. What ends up happening is that you get a pool of gunky water filled with gross mold and whatnots, that the fan then picks up and proceeds to splash on all the fins in the machine, which eventually translates to unpleasant odor being blown into your room whenever it starts up.I rather not be breathing nasty, disease causing air compared to Midea hitting an energy saver milestone. At least give us the option of drain holes with plugs or something so we can choose between efficiency vs cleanliness . Unless you live somewhere really dry, or doesn't need to use this thing often, I cannot recommend a purchase of this unit. Giving it two stars because it actually works well with cooling (so far), but this is a major issue.Also. the fans on the indoor portion of the ac cannot be reached to be cleaned unless you take the entire front portion apart, unhooking wires, cables and all. Very unfriendly design for sustainable general maintenance.

    This product didn’t last a year. It stopped working after a possible “power surge”; however, none of mine appliances were affected. I don’t know if that was the root cause. I followed the manual and I tried to reset it, but it displays 06 EH. I called Midea and requested a technician. “Anthony”, customer service rep, was rude and brash. He kept cutting me off and said he needed a “yes” or “no” answer. He kept putting me on hold to speak with his supervisor. At the end, he said because I said after a “power surge”, it’s not covered by the warranty. How can you make an assessment and assumption without looking at the unit?? Midea…POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE!!

    This product was interesting for the energy savings and reducing noise levels which are a massive annoyance for me. Started out spectacular and still cools well. The problem is 1 year into owning it the unit has devolved a droning electrical buzz that refuses to go away. It is louder when the unit fan speed is on high but still very much loud and present even on the low fan speed. I would much rather get a traditional ac unit going forward and never intend on dealing with this much more frustrating electrical buzz ever again.

The installation is not difficult at all, just a few extra steps than a conventional window unit. So far I’m happy.

    I bought the 8,000 BTU Midea window unit for our master bedroom and now I can set the thermostats for both floors up to about 80° during the night and my master bedroom can be set on 67° for the night. We are empty nesters so this works for us. If your other bedrooms are occupied you probably have to run your central unit or put one of these small units in each bedroom. I don't see the reason to cool my entire 3100 sq ft two story home during the night just to make it comfortabel in the 200 sq ft master bedroom. My electric bill dropped to about 1/3 of what it was and we sleep at a much cooler temperature. The unit is also very quiet on lower speeds. It has a variable speed motor so after the room cools down the unit will run at such a low speed you cannot even hear it. The vent only stays open when the AC is running and sometimes I'll walk by and the vent is open and I'm thinking ""is that thing running"". And I'll put my hand in front of it and I can feel cold air coming out. Although when  you first turn it on and it's running on high speed you can hear it but its more of a louder humm.The only Con is that about once a year you have to vacuum the blades of the squirrel cage fan that blows the cold air or air flow slow down to about nothing. And Midea put some sort of wire quard in front of the squirrel cage fan blade that prevents easy cleaning. Here's what I did; take a pair of pliers and just pull the wire quard out of the unit. To do this you have to bend the air flow cover up in the center and pop it off the two pegs that hold it in to be able to get at the fan. Then pull the grey plastic air diverter blades up out of the holes and set them aside. Then with a pair of pliers or wire cutters pull that damn wire guard out so you get a vacuum in there and vacuum the fan blades. You can probably expect to do this once a year. Once you get the guard out of the way and toss it in the trash the rest of the job is really easy to do once or twice a year.I like the wi-fi app making it easy to set the temp way down. We can be across town and before we are heading home for the evening I'll open my app and turn the unit on. By the time we get up to the bedroom it's 67° while the outside temp is a blazing 100° and the rest of the house is set to 80°. This little unit has paid for itself in the first few months.

    One Week Review:This thing has been great. It was easy to install (I did it myself, though having an extra pair of hands is recommended) , it is very very quiet, and it is keeping my room nice and cool. It does this relatively quickly too. Being able to lower my curtain in between the window and the unit is great as well at keeping the light down. The swing option is amaaaazing. The instructional video they provide is also excellent and easy to follow for the most part.I only have 2 minor complaints. The vented cover on the front doesn't really like to stay in place. It always sticks out on one side. I just taped both sides and it stays. I also don't love how if you power the AC off, it doesn't remember your setting when you turn it back on.5 Stars!

I'd still but it again, in fact we're getting one for the livingrm this spring. We never used the remote, just the app on our phones. Love the app! It cools down 2+ rooms if we keep the door open, and doesn't wake a Infant. Lets see how it is with a toddler this summer.

    This is The Most quietest window AC unit we have ever owned...period!  We set the temperature the day that we installed it and haven't touched it since. We keep it on auto fan and eco cool and the little unit comes on and adjust things on it's own as needed to keep our desired temperature. We've never even put batteries into the remote as we really don't need it. The first unit arrived damaged and Amazon had it picked up and a new one delivered within the week.As a matter of fact, we liked this unit so much that we ordered two more of different BTU sizes to fit our needs....Why?...Because our central air needs to be completely replaced after 20 years and they want almost $9,000 to put in the new outside compressor and the inside blower unit. So these 3 window units are keeping our home just as cool and we saved $7,500 by Not replacing the central air.  Plus, if one goes bad one day, we can just slide it out ourselves and slide a new one in. (Will NEVER have to call some AC company to come out and charge us a fortune ever again)!And financially speaking, with the $7,500 that we saved, we could buy another 15 window units!!! That's right, another 15 window AC units.!!! So as long as our Midea units keep working like they should, we are making out like bandits.

    I’m a contractor and I build and install things all week long every week, year round. I installed this unit for a client today in a attic of a log cabin. Took me about 2.5 hrs to install it. First time I installed this model. I took my time and watched a YouTube video on how to do the installation. The YouTube video was excellent.  All the parts were in the box.  I did have to add cedar shims on the outside of the house for the angle brackets.  I also added some larger deck screws into the window bracket into the window frame. Just to be safe.  The tools I used were impact driver, drill bit to pre drill, a small screw driver, a large screw driver, tape measure, extra deck screws, pencil, a knife to cut the insulation foam.  You would not have to have a impact driver to do this project. I did have a hard time getting the anti tip brackets out after I installed the unit. My suggestion is to take the clear tape off and make sure the anti tip brackets go in and out before you install the unit. The anti tip brackets were kind of hidden. Otherwise it wasn’t that bad to install.  Hope this helps.It’s a neat and well thought out design.

    I love the physical air conditioner itself, it’s quiet and efficient and cools very well and it installs easily.  The phone app for controlling the AC used to work great, but Midea is trying to force everyone onto a new app that fails to connect to the AC the majority of the time which makes this formerly great AC very frustrating to use. I have an iPhone and the App Store also shows that the new app will access my photos and videos and audio recordings— that seems entirely unnecessary for an app that is just supposed to turn on/off an air conditioner and set the temperature.  In conclusion, if you are satisfied using the buttons on the unit, or the included remote control, then this is a great air conditioner, but if you’d like to control the AC remotely or from a smart device then be prepared for frustration and failure.

    Third one now.  They are like having a mini-split system without having to mess with charging gas lines and running tubes.  Very quiet compared to the old fashioned AC boxes.  The variable speed compressor motor being able to run at only the speed needed is such a great improvement over the old style.  We ran 3 of these all summer and our electric bill did go up but not nearly what it used to with the central air system.  At least $100 a month lower.  I'm going to get a 4th one for next Summer to complete my whole house cooling system.  It's definitely worth paying a bit more for this than for a regular box AC.  The lower noise level is worth it for just that alone.

    My wife hates noise in the bedroom at night, but she also hates being too warm in bed, so an air conditioner, for the bedroom is always been a compromise for us.Until we found this one. This machine has a revolutionary design that keeps the “noisy parts” outside the window, where it keeps squirrels awake. On the inside of the window is only a vent and some controls, making for a significantly quieter experience than any air conditioner we’ve ever tried, including a couple that are supposed to be “the worlds quietest”.We used it all summer in ‘22, so only one year of use on this so far, but it worked without a hiccup, and the noise level seemed like less than half of anything we had previously.If I had four thumbs, they would all be pointed up for this product! :-)

The first one is two years old and is no longer working at all, So I reinstalled my seven-year-old window unit from General Electric it’s loud but it works.  I bought this unit about 16 months ago. It’s nice and quiet and works very well. It ran nearly full time 10 or 11 months of that timeframe. Now it’s got a loud hum that sounds like it’s coming from the fan motor.The third unit is about seven months old and working perfectly still.Concept is great, when they work and they work well but for the price they quit working way too soon

    Bought this for my bedroom on the other side of the central air unit in my house.  Love in Florida and the sun is on the other side of the house at bedtime but it's stuffy in the room during day and still warm at night.  In the hottest months I run it at night.  During the rest of the year I run it an hour or half hour just to cool the room down at night and it stays comfortable.  There is a timer on it for that so it's set it and forget it.  It does make strange noises at times and it's shut off on me before without a timer on.  I wake up several times at night so if it's off, I just turn it back on. All in all it's the best window ac I've ever owned.

    My family has been using window AC units for years now as it's much more cost effective than using central (at least with our older model)However, some AC units can get loud and the constant whirring sound gets old.I do NOT have that problem with this one.I have my computer with my mic set up relatively close and I feel pretty confident you could record a podcast with it on if you wanted to.For better reference: I live in Florida and have the 8000BTU model. I only use low as it'll freeze me out even come Summer time!Only ""con"" is that you'll have to get creative with covering as blinds/curtains will stop at the top of the unit and as this doesn't use the ""accordion style"" covering of other models, the window is see through on the sides of the AC.

    I purchased this unit for a bonus room above my garage a little over a year ago, and it plain and simple, and doesn't cool as expected.  The room size is within the 12,000 BTU range, but the unit simply isn't cooling as it should.  This includes turning off ECO mode, setting the temperature to the lowest (66 degrees), and the fan speed on high.  The warranty just went out at the end of October so I am stuck with a $500 u-shaped paperweight.  I definitely cannot recommend this brand to anyone, and if you see the name brand ""Midea,"" run in the other direction.  For reference, I had a GE unit (same 12,000 BTU) that lasted 6 years in the same room. Very disappointed...

    My girlfriend complained of an odor and upon inspection I found the AC was riddled with mold. We have a pretty dry climate in our house, so I looked it up. Apparently this is a known and frequent issue. There are forums on creating a hydrogen peroxide spray and drilling proper drainage holes. I like the design of the AC, and it did an ok job at cooling two rooms (1000BTU would expect more) but this is my first time dealing with mold in an AC unit.

Sadly Midea just told me I was out of warranty and to contact a technician to repair it. No compensation for a defective product or anything. Horrible product. Waste of $400 dollars. The worst product I’ve bought on Amazon and I’ve spent a lot and try to support small companies. Most of them are great but Midea the worst. I have a 7 year old A/C from GE and it works smooth.

    UPDATE!! THE COMPRESSOR CAME BACK TO WORK BY ITSELF AGAIN!I just disconnected the AC, took it  to another room, mounted it in the window, away from the heater, plugged it into  the wall outlet and the compressor started to work again. It doesn't give me the ""EC07"" compressor defective message anymore.  I have been testing it for 3 weeks now, and it is working fine.!  I think that the problem was that in my bedroom where the AC was before, it was receiving too much heat from the heater that was underneath, and that might have affected the electronic part  of the AC.(December 26, 2022)This MIDEA unit broke down after a year and 5 months.It started giving the ""EC07"" DEFECTIVE MESSAGE., This means the ""COMPRESSOR FAILED, IT BROKE DOWN"".I called customer service, they advise to call the repair company.They said they won't repair it because their warranty only lasts one year.This unit also has problem common with other AC unit: the fan collects mold and heavy dust inside the fan.I called the company and they don't offer any advise on how to clean it; they said you should call a repair service to clean it and you have to pay for it.The company also doesn't recommend to spray water to clean the dust and mold.  And also they don't recommend you to do it yourself.This is how other people clean the other brand of AC that they have.Other people had the same problem, according with the reviews I checked.I am searching for a new AC unit from another brand.

    I bought my Midea 8000BTU AC in October 2020 and loved it for 1.5 years. Due to allergies and asthma, I run my AC and air purifier in the bedroom nightly. In the last year, my allergy symptoms in the mornings have worsened. I’ve had to clean mold off the swing arm a couple times (see pic). Last week, I shined a flashlight into the unit and saw rust buildup on the metal bars and mold inside the unit. I can’t dismantle the unit to clean inside and Midea doesn’t include a planned maintenance schedule or authorized service places, so I guess Midea doesn’t plan on customers using their AC units long term.  In order to avoid health problems, I’ll  be throwing this Midea AC out and purchasing a unit that’s made to use long-term and designed to be serviced every year.

    Good little a/c unit for the garage
  
",5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,jettatrekgirl,2023年3月8日 在美国审核,"







  
  
    I bought this for my garage. I live in Alabama. It is March 7, 2023 and was 86 degrees today. This air conditioner was delivered today, so you know I had to install it! Packaging was easy to remove. Now, I must have the world's smallest window in my garage. It's an old, metal frame window. When I read the description, it seemed like it would fit perfectly after measuring my window. The unit itself fit no problem. The issue was the side panels. It was just like an inch too big horizontally to fit my window. However, I remedied this issue by cutting an inch off of the left and right panel frames. Doing this allowed it to fit perfectly. The height was fine. The screws it comes with are kind of junk, but they work for what you need. Also, the mounting brackets didnt work for me, but again, I have some crazy windowns, apparently. So I made my modifications, installed it, and turned it on. Initially, it made a lot of noise kicking on the first time. Now it's quite quiet. It's blowing out some seriously cold air. I am in the process of insulating my garage (already did the garage doors, working on throwing up the panels on the rafters). I think this is going make working on my cars during the summer exponentially better. I don't know how it will do in the full blown summer yet, but I have high hopes. It will at least be tolerable. I'll update in a few months if anything goes wrong with it. Side note: if you want to insulate your garage with insulation panels, go to Lowes over home depot. I got Poly Pro 3/4"" thick 4' x 8' panels for approx. $15 a piece. Just use a sharp utility knife to cut it and gorilla glue hot glue sticks to mount it to your garage door panels (you'll need to put blocks of the insulation panels on the garage doors before you install your cut panels or else the height won't be right. You'll know what I'm talking about if you go to do it.) Thank me later.

    I took a chance on the ""like new"" return.  Since other reviews said it had a design fault of not having a drain hole for condensation, I figured I could solve it with a drill if needed.  The description of the one that I selected said the box had cosmetic damage, but that the unit was like new.  Well, the owners manual and installation guide was still wrapped in plastic, unopened.  That was the only part ""like new""1. All the mounting hardware was missing.2. The fresh air vent was broke off and wedged in the fan blades.3. The front looked like it had been pried off, and then the prior owners seem to have tried to reattach it with silicone glue.4. The electrical plug was crushed, with the ground plug broke off.5. The plastic on the inside was covered with paint and silicone.6. The metal cabinet was badly crushed on one side, it looked like it might have fallen out of a window7. Despite the prior owners troubles, they must have got it working for a while, as the filter had a good layer of dog hair (or maybe cat or llama?) covering it. It was also obvious it had been run a while as their was plenty of residue from dried up water in the back, that hadn't drained out.Initially, I was just going to see if I could return it.  But I repair stuff, so I figured I might as well see what it would take to get it running.  I was able to take apart the cabinet, (after scraping illicit silicon of the screw heads) as per the instructions and get the fresh air vent and lever out of the fan blades and back in place. Also, since I had followed the instructions for taking off the front, I was able to get it back together correctly, unlike the prior owners.  The plug is missing the ground plug, clean broke off, but I was able to bend the other prongs into shape enough to plug it in for a brief test.  (I will have to cut the end off and add a new 3 prong repair before actually using it--it would be dangerous to use a metal appliance without a ground!  Unfortunately, this will mean cutting out the GFCI protection at the end of the cord. But I will be plugging it into a GFCI outlet, so that will provide the needed protection.)  After letting it run a while, it did start blowing cold air.  Living in the Pacific Northwest, I only plan to use it a few weeks during the summer. So I guess I will keep it.  But I won't be able to review any other qualities, or lack thereof, until then.

The fan still runs and it blows air, but it's no longer cooling. It's been very well taken care of, gently removed from the window and stored carefully in between uses. Very disappointing.

    I have had the unit a year and a half.  The touch panel on the unit stop working. I cannot change the mode or adjust the temperature.  The remote control doesn't work either even after installing new batteries.  I usually turn the temperature up during the day and lower it for the night. One day after I set the temperature for 74 during the day I could not lower it to 70 for the night.  Pressing the remote, I am not exaggerating, at least 200 times, I was able to get it down to 72 which is a happy medium for me.  A unit that is less than two years old should not be doing this.

    Never put a AC window unit in before. It makes some splash noises and scratch noises sometimes when it starts but it goes away after a minute. Remote control is super iffy, it works but it seems out of sync at some times. The remote temp won’t match the number displayed on the unit but it can be synced easily again. Gets my room below room temp so it works. Dehumidifier works great, has an option to just put that on alone, so that’s cool. Unit smelled like fish for a couple days, I don’t know what that was about but it went away and hasn’t come back since, might’ve been on my end. Overall I guess I’m happy with my purchase

    Great product! Energy efficiency is excellent. Rebates might be available through your local power company. My power company gave me a $25 rebate towards my electric bill for this AC unit because it met all the qualifications. The window slider between the inside and outside of the room is pretty thin. I put some insulation and reflective material there to give it more of an R-Value as you can see in the picture. It cools the master bedroom just fine in the deep south which has high humidity. Master bedroom is around 16 feet by 12 feet. It is not loud or noisy, but you can hear it. You will need to buy a bracket of some sort to help hold it in position or else you will risk it falling out onto the ground.

    I use the unit for two purposes:1. To keep my LOUD central unit from running so often.2. To keep my bedroom frosty for better quality sleep.By running the unit in my bedroom, it prevents the central AC from coming on nearly as often. The hum of the AC in the background is just fine.When I go to bed, I turn the thermostat on the central unit up and shut the bedroom door.  It is delightfully cold.I recommend this unit.

    This little AC works so well, I damn near have a sentimental attachment to it.  I used it for my bedroom, and it would get ice cold within minutes.  I slept like Elsa in her ice castle all summer in the Texas heat.  I even woke up chilly in the mornings!  I didn’t notice a huge jump in utilities.. honestly it probably saved money .  Instead of my house AC running all day trying to keep up with the Texas heat, I’d turn this this little bad boy on and bump up my house AC so it didn’t have to work so hard.  I don’t need it cold in the entire house, only my room.  Anyways, I’d give this AC 10 stars if I could.  Easy to clean filter too.

    The AC itself is great. But the 2-in-1 hose design is terrible. It does not work for locations where the openings are already there, because they are, naturally, made for 2 separate ""normal"" hoses. For people who want to use their existing wall-with-openings setup, this is a deal-breaker.If there is any way to get or make an adapter from this DUO thingy to 2 normal hoses, please provide a pointer!

     The Midea Duo on the surface seems like a good unit. In fact, maybe it is if not for the extremely poor assembly of the electrical components on the one I received. The unit right out of the box, started blowing GFIs on the circuit. After well over $1000 in Electrician visits and parts replacements, we decided the issue is with the GFI on the unit itself.Opened up and find frayed power conductors - and not enough current carrying capacity because the strands are broken.So put a normal cord on there and got rid of the GFI on it  and wouldn’t you know it it actually functions correctly when the wires are not destroyed in the first place.Not only was this thing, a fire hazard the way it came out of the box, but a complete waste of everyone’s time.

    Fantastic. Quiet, powerful, easy to use and setup. The adapters could have been a little better, but it's a minor quibble.I am using this in a Florida room in Florida that is typically akin to a greenhouse. There is zero insulation, a metal roof, and the thing was always warm even WITH other AC's running. I decided to try this one - and let me tell you, it's a miracle. The room is icy cold midday with the sun beating down and the temperature outside 96 degrees.It runs quiet, uses less electric than the previous units, and is simple to use and program.

Unit has an inverter fan and maybe compressor. Fan speed can be ajusted though the app (1%-100% and also low med hi), but on the remote and unit it is only Low Med High. Doesn't bother me too much though. It also has auto speed which I don't know which fan speed selction it uses.Remote:The remote annoys me. Not the thing itself, but how it oporates. When I cahange a setting on the remote, everything is fine. But when I change a setting on the unit, it does not change on the remote. This is very anoying because then I have to go through all the fan speeds or cylcle power on the remote ans hopefuly not short cylcle the unit. Other than that, the remote is great.Overall:Overall the unit was worth 700$. It keeps me warm and cool and has good controls. Does not make water very often, which is nice. Other than the remote, the unit is great.

    THIS LITTLE BUGGER DEHUMIDIFIES WONDERFULLY
  
",5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,SOCRATES,2023年3月19日 在美国审核,"







  
  
    This unit is compact, has wheels, a nice strong cord and plug-in, and is powerful for its size. It cools a normal-sized room quickly (with a window exhaust), and it dehumidifies a normal-sized room quickly as well. The best part is, unlike most models, this one does NOT need a window vent to dehumidify. It has a water release nozzle on the very bottom, making releasing water captured out of the air in your room very easy to empty. You do NOT have to empty the water with each used, but only after it builds up in the catch basin. Overall, this is great unit. It is heavy, so the wheels come in handy. If you have carpeting, sorry, but it will be hard to wheel around. If you have flat hard-surface floors you are in luck.

    First off the item arrived in a box beat up and old covered in dust. No bottom to the box just the styrofoam bottom and everything held together with shipping straps. Which meant when it came time to return it, I had no way to seal it. So I had to stuff everything into a wardrobe box and use a half a roll of tape because this thing is heavy.So just be aware that should you have to return this item, you better have your own box ready. Unless I just got some random piece of inventory that they did this too.The first two nights it worked very well. It cooled off our bedroom and it ran all night. The next night I woke up in the morning and it was no longer blowing air. The fan had turned off. I cycled the power and it started running again only to cut off a few hours later. The power stayed on but the fan stopped blowing air. The duration by which this thing would stay on would get smaller and smaller. To the point that by day four, it would only stay on for about 10 minutes before cycling off. It was not set to timer nor was it set to auto. It was set to high fan and cool with the timer off. I would have loved for this thing to work because it did cool off our room for the two days that it actually worked. But man what a complete pain in the butt it was to try to return this thing.

    Haven't gotten to test the cooling function but I bought it because it's supposed to heat the room. The heat function blows semi warm air and will get a room to somewhat warm but stops functioning if it gets below 40°f which kinda defeats the purpose of buying such an expensive product. Beyond that, it's a gorgeous unit and the remote and app functionality are cool but the mounting equipment are to be desired and don't stay put very well. Ultimately I'll be returning it for a refund because not heating the room is a deal breaker

    This machine works great, but I live in a humid environment and the water tray is very small. It builds up sludge very quickly due to this and there is no way to access the water tray to fix the issue.  If you remove the exhaust hose you can maybe drop a tablet in there if you have good aim, but its very difficult and did not resolve my issue. As such about once a month I have to go outside and backwash the drain hole with water to attempt to dislodge and break up the sludge. This is sadly only temporary and very time consuming. I attempted to contact their support but they refused to help me at all and constantly asked for irrelevant information that I still supplied until eventually ignoring my request for support stating I had no warranty.I have attempted to resolve the issue myself by disassembling the unit but even with 100% of all screws removed it is still attached in multiple ways that are not intuitive or known, the last thing I want to do is break the device.So the rating is greatly lowered due to inability to resolve this issue and complete lack of support.

    Awesome Portable AC/Heater!
  
",5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,js,2023年2月25日 在美国审核,"







  
  
    I bought this because I live in a rental in Texas which is a very old and poorly insulated house. We do have central air but it costs a fortune to run and struggles with the Texas heat. The Midea is for a bedroom that's only about 300 square foot, which sounds like overkill but my old 10k BTU Black and Decker had trouble cooling to 80 on our 100 degree + days. This unit should also be cheaper to run since it's much more energy efficient.I really wanted the extra BTUs for cooling more than I wanted the heater but I'm already making use of it thanks to a brief late February cold snap.  I had accidentally set it to automatic mode while setting it up and very quickly realized it had warmed my room up, now I'm really glad I got the Duo. Before when we would have big temperature swings at night I'd have to go to sleep with the AC set to 72 and a space heater set to 66, otherwise I'd either go to bed sweating or wake up freezing. Now I've got one unit that keeps my room at 72 all night despite the wild temperature swings outside.As far as noise goes The Midea has a much more powerful fan so naturally, that is louder but it's compressor is actually much quieter than the Black and Decker.. no more loud buzzing when the AC kicks on.I'll try to update this review once we start getting 100-degree weather and I see how it handles Texas summers.

    I am late with this review so my apologies.  I wanted to see how it turned out.  Out of the box it worked fine, a few weeks later it stopped working.  The service department gave me a few things to try, none of the suggestions worked so we agreed to refund the purchase price and they did not want to pay for shipping it back.  The refund never arrived.  So I had a local AC shop look at it.  A simple fix but it cost $150.  Also it was supposed to be a heat pump.  It's not.  I do not recommend it just because the company does not back it up.  Count on having to pay someone to fix it, so add $150 for repairs.  Also do not expect a heat pump.  After all that and paying someone to fix it, it has performed well as an AC since them and it works with Alex most of the time.

The app is great and allows for remote controlling and scheduling!  It didn't make it through the whole summer so I contacted customer support and sent the error codes from the app.  They were very eager to assist  and quick to uphold the warranty without any push back or surprises.  I also have a different midea ac which is a beast... I think I just got a dud for this one.  Overall the workmanship is good and I am a happy customer.  The only feedback would be to allow the fan setting to vent outside air in for those cool nights.  Would purchase again.

    I am not sure this duo portable heater is any good for heating, especially when it starts getting extremely cold (say 20F to 30F). Initially there was no obvious error as to why my heating on this unit suddenly stopped. I got curious to check the mobile app and decided to run a check on the Unit - I found out that there was one abnormal result of the 113 checks that completed.abnormal check - cold wind protection (p9). As there is no useful information on the app, I decided to check online and still nothing, so I'm assuming that the system has somehow disabled the heating feature because it senses cold air entering the unit and hence becoming inoperable (in heating mode) possibly to protect the refrigerant or something

The dang thing is plastic so I can't even break it down to start a fire with it. Thanks, Midea! Now I know why I'm telling people about your brand, rather than hearing about it. Hopefully y'all don't see me hauled off on the news like a caveman frozen in a block of ice.

    The AC worked great on this thing, but when the weather turned cooler, the heat worked for about a week, before no longer functioning. I troubleshooted it for a while, to no avail. Very frustrating as I only spent so much money on this unit because it also was a heater :/

    During a recent failure of our building's central AC, our small server room hit 106 degrees F.  The surrounding rooms were 85 F with no heat on.  Uncomfortable for us and bad for the servers!We put this in there, ducted it to the room's one small window, set it to 80 degrees, and turned it on.An hour later, it was down to 95 F in the server room.  When we returned the next morning, it was 80 degrees in there, and the surrounding rooms were back to 72 F.Disaster averted!Compared to many others, the real advantage of this unit is that the duct is split between intake and outflow.  Meaning it has two loops internally.  One from and to the room and the second from and to the outside.  It exchanges the heat from the room loop to the outside loop and then sends the air from each back where it came from.This means it cools highly efficiently without creating negative pressure in the room by exhausting hot air outside without replacing it.This doesn't cool as much as central AC but costs less to operate.  For those times of year (spring and fall) when we only need AC because of the server room, this may save us money!If this thing can cool 2.5kW of servers and switches, it ought to do a pretty good job in any household application.The one thing I really can't weigh in on is the noise level; that room already has a ""hearing protection required to enter"" sign on the door.If I could change one thing, I would make the included duct longer.  But given our niche use, that's probably not an issue for most people.

    Cool One Room at a Time
  
",4.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,J Mac,2022年11月27日 在美国审核,"







  
  
    This item arrived on time as expected. It is heavy but easy to install. I should have ordered one with 10,000BTUS, but it managed to cool a slightly larger room area than it recommended. The room was never cold (nor do I like it that way). It was always comfortably cool, compared to the outdoors. It drained about 1-1/2 gallons of water into a bucket every 3-4hrs. on very warm days. So, I'd only run it (or set the timer) when I would be home to empty the bucket. I wouldn't say this unit runs EXTREMELY loud, but it isn't ""quiet,"" either. Imagine the outside part of a window AC being in the house. If you're working at home, watching TV, or listening to anything else, it's distracting...but unavoidable. My overall critique is that a portable AC unit is meant to cool a single room, not an entire home. I accept that and limit myself to just one room. My goal is to stay nice and comfy, while I manage several chronic health issues. Considering the last summer with 90+degree weather, which melted my window blinds, having this portable device is much better than trying to sleep with no AC.

    Does its job well, but does it very loudly. This thing can cool off a 100sqft room with south-facing windows in August in 5-10 minutes, but that’s all I could stand to run it for without headphones on. If you’re looking for an AC unit for a small space with a window and you have any sensitivity to sound, just accept the hassle of installing a window AC and get one of the U-shaped Midea units—they’re genuinely quiet and efficient, and a better value.

    The item itself is great, but the condition it came in was not. It was sold as “used - like new.” It is NOT like new. I was able to install it but the window fittings were cut up already and I had to use tape and glue to piece them back together so I could use it. Because of this, there are leaks from the outside now. It should have been sold as used - fair condition. And it shouldn't have cost as much as it did. I'm really upset about it, because my electric bill will suffer due to the leaks. And now in the winter, I have to uninstall it so that I don't have leaks from outside. Terrible.

    Midea needs to make the fan inside the unit accessible. I've used this one season and now it is full of mold. I had to take the whole thing apart to get to it. I started getting sick and noticed mold on top of the unit. When I looked inside I couldn't believe it. I kept the water drained. It did not sit without being used. I do live in Alabama and it is extremely humid but this is beyond. A whole weekend project. Now I hope it works when I get it back together.  Was useless like it was. It is a very good a/c and heater. Just don't know if I'm willing to do this every few months.  I have two of these.

    Man, I was really really hopeful when I found this unit. Seemed like it was exactly what I needed, heat/AC in one unit. AC worked great all summer, temps got over 100 several times. The major problem is the heating ability, the majority of the country gets below 45 degrees in the winter. The heater simply won't work when it is below that which renders it completely useless making me use a separate space heater in the small building. This is a side the fact that my unit wouldn't pump the water out and was leaking making me go through a replacement process. I will be searching for another option. Pretty disappointing. Purchased through Lowe's but I know everyone reads reviews on Amazon.

This unit works great if the outdoor temperature is within the operating temperature range. Once the temperature gets to 45°F the heater will struggle to blow hot air, and after the temperature gets to 41°F the heat pump will not start at all. The unit was designed to function this way.This unit also struggles to blow cold air once the temperature gets above 88°F, but the unit will continue to operate regardless of how hot it gets outside.Do not purchase this unit if you plan to use it in temperatures beyond the operating temperature range, because it simply cannot do it. In my experience, it seems to be more sensitive to the temperature inside the hose than the temperature inside the room. If I heat up the room with a separate heater the heat pump still will not engage if the outside temperature is out of operating range.

    I like how easy the set up was and the multiple ways of controlling the unit. I especially like that even of I'm not on the wifi network, that I can still control the unit from anywhere. One of the things I don't like is the fan speed. I feel it's pretty slow even at its highest setting. I wish there was a way to make it a little stronger. Also, having the vent point at its lowest setting, reduces the fan speed. I also feel that the coldest setting isn't that cold. Even for a room slightly smaller than its max capacity, it has a hard time keeping the room cold. On the hottest day, the ac unit felt like it was struggling to keep up. I'm sure if the room was a lot smaller, it would probably work fine. I gave it a 3 star rating mostly because of how much I liked the controls. And the Alexa feature is awesome.

",2.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,WARPed,2022年10月23日 在美国审核,"







  
  
    I'd love to be able to recommend this unit. It is generally quiet (can get temporarily loud at random times which is bad in a bedroom overnight), has good features, a great remote, and sips power (relatively) but the unit is poorly sealed and as a result outside air easily enters your home via the intake hose when the unit is off, and when it is on it sucks air from your home to blow out the exhaust causing negative pressure and external air to be sucked in from other ingress points around the home.I have two of these units purchased 4 months apart. When I owned the first one it was installed in such a location that the negative pressure was not noticeable but when I brought a second unit and placed it in my bedroom I noticed it would pull the door open if not properly latched when the AC was turned on. Glad of the cool air and happy with the other features I put it to the back of my mind until the wildfire season came and the stink billowed out both units horribly. Placing my nose near the rear body vent it became clear that the smell was entering via the intake hose when the unit was off. I also noticed that on cooler nights a cold draft would drift from the same vents.I removed the dual hose from the unit to investigate and noticed large dust deposits around the poorly sealing areas around where the hose mates to the AC body. Flashing a flashlight around I also realized that the holes in the back of the unit for the plug to sit in go directly into the external air chamber allowing another place for air to mix. Similarly more holes further down the back of the unit do the same. Shine a flashlight around the underside and you will see light shine up unimpeded into the external air chamber. The hole in the bottom where the power cable exits is so large I can fit a whole finger in it (as well as the power cable) and that too goes straight into the external air chamber.In short, while I have no doubt this unit creates much less negative pressure issues than a single hose unit if you are expecting to keep outside air out (including pollution and smells) this unit will fail you miserably. It defeats one of the main selling points. It makes it useless as a heater in the winter as so much cold air will seep into the house defeating another major selling point. I'm sad I paid so much for a system that is so poorly designed and built. Remember, I have two of these unit and both are the same. They were purchased 4 months apart so this is not a one off or a problem with a specific lot.  It has a great feature set but this takes all that away. Wish I'd never brought them.

    This is perfect for what I needed & well worth my investment. I have a small bedroom with a window that requires vertical placement of the hose. In order to adjust the window insert, a saw was required. I opted to skip this step, as the space left by leaving the second piece out was no more than half an inch & I didn't want to fuss with it. The unit cools my space almost immediately and while there is some noise, I did not find it bothersome & in fact, it provided some nice extra white noise for sleeping. The remote control is also very handy, but the temp on the unit & the temp on the control sometimes read differently. I can decrease the temp on the remote to 72, but the unit doesn't respond & will still read 74. I find that if I make sure the remote is aiming straight for the unit, this happens less frequently. It's much like using a TV remote, it can't have anything blocking the remote and the receiver. Also, because it is portable, when my landlord sent out a notice that on October 1st all window units needed to be taken down, I didn't have to remove mine. I could continue to use it when the days were still warm. Overall, I'm super glad I made the choice to purchase this air conditioner and would recommend it to anyone looking for a simple set up unit that really works & doesn't break your bank.

    Makes our downstairs an ice box.

    We needed a portable AC unit because our house on base doesn't have AC (in southern California of all places).  This unit cools off our entire downstairs in just 20-30 minutes (approx 1000sq feet).  It's super quiet and the remote control works well.  Well worth the price tag.  It was also easy to install.

    Thoughts on the Midea Duo 14,000 BTU after two months of ownership
  
",5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,Taj,2022年10月8日 在美国审核,"I waited a couple of months to see how the experience held up before submitting a review. Before purchase I had wondered about the drainage situation, performance, and overall noise level. I can address these points fully now.

The Midea Duo is a wonderful machine -- in a small bedroom (roughly 11x11) setting this to the lowest setting (60 degrees Fahrenheit) will actually take a space this small down into the mid / upper 50s. This is while the machine copes easily with southeastern heat and humidity outside.

I watched a Youtube reviewer test the noise level, and yes, that very low decibel rating is accurate with one caveat. The minimum noise level advertised only happens on low fan when the unit is in air circulation mode, no AC active -- the compressor running will easily exceed that level even on the lowest settings.

Don't get me wrong -- I work at a desk approximately four feet away from the unit and I have absolutely no issues doing my job. There is a quirk of the unit where when the AC first activates, it briefly will spin everything up to maximum even with the settings configured to low / medium. This will last about thirty seconds before the inverter tech kicks in and the compressor drops into background noise. This is my only pet peeve overall.

I am unsure as to why there isn't a ""quiet mode"" setting where it will run the compressor at a low setting more often for longer periods to maintain temperature versus needing to run full power for a bit. I would absolutely love this as a feature. Sending the compressor all the way to maximum and maximum fans briefly before stepping back and operating quietly is annoying, but I will note that I do not consider this loud enough to interrupt my day. Sitting further away will mitigate the issue completely.

The noise is never enough to wake me from sleep and isn't ""terrible"". On normal low AC settings outside of the initial ""start up"" where it runs full tilt, I would say it is about as loud as box fan set to medium-low. The full start up level of noise for the compressor is approximately as loud as a window AC running on full. You will definitely notice the different stages as it cycles up and down.

This thing will freeze you out of a room and quickly drop the temperature. I have never seen anything like it. Even dealing with Florida heat and humidity it was able to take a heat soaked room that was in the upper 80s down to the low 70s in a span of two hours.

I had some concerns about needing to drain this vs a comparable Whynter unit with their exhaust technology. Those concerns were unfounded -- even with Florida humidity I have never needed to drain the unit. I have checked multiple times but I have never had more than a few drops of water in the tank. The AC exhausts the water vapor efficiently out through the window and does not seem to accumulate much at all.

I have not needed to use the dehumidifying option, so that option may require more draining. For normal AC use you will probably not need to drain it often at all. If you live in a drier climate than Florida, you will probably never need to give draining it a second thought at all.

Installation was not difficult for one person and all needed adapters / panels are provided. Midea supplies extra panels and adapters in case you need extensions. I do recommend reviewing the instructions and using the dampening foam panels to keep outside noise and heat away. You can install it without the instructions (it's that simple) but your life will be much easier if you read the manual. :) Make sure to install the hose flow separator at the end of the vent or your performance will not be as great.

Once the foam is installed and the window secured with the included foam liners, outside noise is no worse than what it was before with the window closed. Midea has done very well in thinking of customer comfort.

Durability -- it cools just as well as it did on day one. It has, however, developed a very annoying rattle/vibration when the compressor spins up and goes to full power. This sounds like something vibrating loose in the unit and this happened a few weeks into ownership.

If I press my hand to the side of the unit this is goes away, so perhaps some piece of sound insulation has let go internally? I do not know if it is a defect since it is cooling perfectly, but I had to take away from the noise level stars because this is annoying and something I notice daily. Before it started doing this vibration-rattle the unit was much quieter.

Purely fan mode is wonderfully quiet, so I know this has to be coming from the compressor somehow.

Make sure to clean and check the filters, as the mesh is very fine and this unit needs the airflow to operate at best performance. I have not needed to use the heat function since we're still in the upper 80s and 90s, but will update as I use it.

The remote control is good for when you don't want to get out of bed to change settings, but I find the app to be easier to use. The remote can do most of the things the buttons on the unit will do minus a few options that require the unit buttons to be held down. The app will let you fine tune most settings on the unit and select fan speeds beyond low, medium, or high. I would like to see full control from the app with all settings that can be adjusted on the unit itself.

Our power bill did not increase by much using the AC. Part of this is probably helped by the Midea taking some of the strain off of the old (and inefficient) wall units here. I normally leave it set to low fan circulation and around 72 degrees on the AC. It uses much less power than a comparable window unit and I would absolutely not have anything other than an inverter driven AC at this point. The technology is that good.

Would I buy another Midea again? Absolutely. There are improvements they can make to the overall build quality (addressing the various vibrations / rattles that have appeared) and settings (a quiet AC mode would be greatly appreciated), but overall this is very comparable with the best that Whynter has to offer and the thoughtfulness of the app is wonderful.

It is not cheap, but the price gives you a tremendous performance and feature combination. I have no doubt that this would cool a large living room or combined space with ease. Thank you to Midea for saving me from Florida Summer!

Edit and followup: I attached two decibel measurements. The average for medium fan is 54 and the average for the unit running in AC mode is 61 with spikes up to 68.

I finally ran the heat and it works great, though it will collect a lot of humidity as condensation in the trays. The unit is very easy to drain, but you can also switch to dry mode to have the unit evaporate and exhaust the water.","颜色: 黑色//白色尺寸: 14,000 BTU with Heat","颜色: 黑色//白色尺寸: 14,000 BTU with Heat",https://www.amazon.com/MAP08R1CWT-Portable-Conditioner-Dehumidifier-control/product-reviews/B087CQVC9G/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_paging_btm_next_7?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&pageNumber=7

    First, this is a 70lb unit.  It is heavy.  Second it works great for sash windows and sliding aluminum but has no adapter for french type side hinged windows.  Having said that, this is one nice unit.  It is quiet,  My last floor model shook the house and the fan was very noisy.  This one does not even disturb dinner from 8 feet away.  I don't know the decibels but they must be around 50 or so.  Quiet.  And it cools the place down.  I used it in a 1400 sq ft two br apartment with a 900 sq foot living room and dining area.  The apartment is 2nd floor and very warm.  This morning it was topping 85 at 9 am.  We installed this AC and blocked the window opening with the lightproof curtains to reduce the heat and force the hot air out.  Within 1/2 hour the temp inside the living room area was 72.  Wow.  That is a lot of area to cool.  But it did and it even cycled.  Bought another.  Love the heating too.  Saves gas big time.

     The unit itself is quiet, well designed, and functions well, as described in other reviews here. My main issues are with the window hardware and duct. The window mount and adapter is not sturdy enough and the clips that hold the parts together are not strong enough. My basement install reaches the limit of the exhaust duct length, so it applies a bit of force to the mounting clips. This scenario should be expected for this type of unit. The clips have a tendency to pop out constantly. The vertical adapter required for my sliding windows adds another set of weak clips that can pop out, causing additional grief. And that vertical adapter cannot fit into a vertical window with bulky trim around it without modification (tough to explain - see video). The window is now an obvious security risk since everything can be pushed in easily to access the window. Once everything is in place and settled, this unit has worked very well for cooling my ~550 sq. ft. space. I'll have to update my review with my experience using the heating function after the winter months.

    Cools Like a Beast, but Doesn't Dehumidify.
  
",3.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,Lonnie Christopher,2022年9月25日 在美国审核,"







  
  
    First-day use impressions: It cools like a beast and works way better than our previous portable AC. Powerfan and cooling with lots of automated options and controls via phone app, remote, or Alexa.  The only negative thing I have to say about it is that I have not been able to get the dry mode to lower humidity at all. It doesn't seem to do anything in DRY mode more than it does in Cool mode. There is no drainage at all in DRY mode, in fact, nothing changes when I switch between Cool and Dry. I thought the fan was supposed to slow down, but it doesn't. The dry mode was one of the main reasons why I bought this unit so for that I had to subtract a few stars. I'll contact support on Monday to see if something is wrong with the unit and update you.Update: I contacted support and they had no real solutions and told me that I have to disconnect the hose from the outside vent in DRY mode!?!?!?, which I tried, and then it just heated up the room and didn't dry any better. This seems like a huge design flaw and had I known it I probably wouldn't have purchased it Their only suggestion was to return it, and that seems like a huge hassle, but may be best.Six-month update: It still works like a beast and I can attest that it uses much less energy than my last unit. The biggest issue I have found so far is the plastic clips that connect the hose to the window piece are plastic. I have broken two of them already and I don't see how they wouldn't break fairly easily after a few times connecting and disconnecting the hose. Plan on replacing this piece every few years. These should have been made of stronger materials. Being that this connection is a very crucial part of its function I am lowering my score another star. If it can't connect to the window it basically useless.

    Window kit is awful. AC itself is good (but useless without good window kit)
  
",3.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,Sasha K.,2022年9月19日 在美国审核,"







  
  
    I would have given this AC 5 stars if the window adapter wasn’t such an awful piece of junk. The adapter piece is very stiff and when we were connecting it, the attachment piece snapped clean off. We read other reviews that complained about the window kit so we were very careful and it still broke. I contacted the manufacturer and they sent me a link to purchase a replacement piece  for $80 (and $10 shipping so $90 total). We tried to tape it, but it just wouldn’t hold so we caved and ordered the replacement. Hopefully it doesn’t break a second time. The whole window panel piece just isn’t very sturdy. Definitely prepare to get creative with installation if you do make this purchase.The AC itself is great, except that you can’t really turn it or have it stand at an angle because the hose is very stiff and it needs to stand right where your window opening is. But it’s quieter than our other AC and cools our room well.Bottom line: I would have rather just paid $100 extra from the beginning if it meant the window kit would be good quality. Overall, I’m glad we got this AC. Just hoping the manufacturer listens to feedback and improves the window kit.

    I was a little hisitant at first because I never heard of the brand. The positive reviews on this portable AC are mostly accurate.I hope it will continue to perform as expected especially on the energy saving part since it is an inverter.The dual hose really plays a significant role in improving and speeding up the cooling process. Remote and wifi enabled feature is really a game changer.

    The A/C works very well.The intake/exhaust is open to the outside when installed.  Rain can get in (and settle in the intake/exhaust hose).  Birds can get into the hose. Squirrels and other vermin can get into the hose.I asked Midea if they had any type of cover/screen.  They said no and that I should contact my local hardware store.So, I am building a hood (that I must attach to my exterior brick wall) and also cover the intake/exhaust with some type of mesh to keep the critters out). If you are not a handyman, be prepared to contract one OR just live with the rain/critters.Not a trivial project, but it just seems a hood/screen should be part of the package.PS: this screen from Amazon seems like a good purchase: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09FPRTKJL?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsNow exploring some weatherproof lumber to build a hood outside the lower part of my window that holds the intake/exhaust and attaches to the brick outer wall.

However, there is no way to turn off the dehumidifier option and the air is EXTREMELY dry. I had to purchase a humidifier in addition to the air conditioner and I still wake up with a sore throat and dehydrated every morning.Also, the P1 error appears frequently even when the tray has hardly any water in it.

    This has made our small apartment survivable during an extended hot summer.  A single-hose portable AC is never as efficient as a 2-hose or window unit, and won't cool as much -- that is the nature of them.  But this is equal to others I've used.  It's not quite, but it's not the noisiest I've heard either.  The hose is easy to attach (and remove from) the back of the unit, and to the outlet at the other end:  no hose clamps to mess with.

    I am not allowed to have a window unit in my condo building, and getting a PTAC was looking to be at least 8k because of some electrical and structural issues. I was using a portable AC from Toshiba, but it was so loud and barely cooled me while blowing straight on me. I saw a good review for this unit and so far it has been an answer to my prayers. It is really quiet and cools my studio apartment well. I have not used the heat function yet, but I hope that will also be helpful. It's a bit bulky and I wish that it came in white, but its definitely much better than spending 8k or dealing with my old portable ac.
